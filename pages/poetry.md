FROM the besieged Ardea all in post,<BR>
Borne by the trustless wings of false desire,<BR>
Lust-breathed Tarquin leaves the Roman host,<BR>
And to Collatium bears the lightless fire<BR>
Which, in pale embers hid, lurks to aspire<BR>
And girdle with embracing flames the waist<BR>
Of Collatine's fair love, Lucrece the chaste.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Haply that name of 'chaste' unhappily set<BR>
This bateless edge on his keen appetite;<BR>
When Collatine unwisely did not let<BR>
To praise the clear unmatched red and white<BR>
Which triumph'd in that sky of his delight,<BR>
Where mortal stars, as bright as heaven's beauties,<BR>
With pure aspects did him peculiar duties.<BR>
