###By John Milton

What needs my Shakespeare for his honoured bones,<br>
The labor of an age in pilèd stones,<br>
Or that his hallowed relics should be hid<br>   
Under a star-ypointing pyramid?<br>
Dear son of Memory, great heir of fame,<br>
What need’st thou such weak witness of thy name?<br>
Thou in our wonder and astonishment<br>
Hast built thyself a live-long monument.<br>
For whilst to th’ shame of slow-endeavouring art,<br>   
Thy easy numbers flow, and that each heart<br>   
Hath from the leaves of thy unvalued book<br>
Those Delphic lines with deep impression took,<br>   
Then thou, our fancy of itself bereaving,<br>   
Dost make us marble with too much conceiving;<br>
And so sepúlchred in such pomp dost lie,<br>
That kings for such a tomb would wish to die.<br>
