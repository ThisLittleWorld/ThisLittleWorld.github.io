###By Margaret Oliphant

IT is common to say that no actor
upon the English stage, who has
any ambition or love for his profession,
can die happy without having
once at least attempted to represent
Hamlet. It is the part
which inspires the most imperfect,
and leads on the most experienced
in never-failing pursuitof an excellence
to come — a laurel always there
for the winning. It is, we are also
told by those who know the stage
well, although one of the most
difficult of all the creations of
poetry, the one also in which absolute
failure is less common than in
any other. No one, perhaps, of all
its many representativeshas given
us a complete impersonation of the
strange and wonderful being whom
we never completely understand,
whom we discuss and quarrel over
all our lives, but whom, at least, we
know, as we know few other of our
lifelong friends;
while at the same
time, every one who has attempted
the part has gotsome hold on humanity
through those words, which the
merest mouther of phrases cannot
spoil, and that most touching and
terrible position which, even when
we do not understand it, we feel,
moving us to the bottom of our
hearts. Whether it is a doctrinaire
who is upon the stage, grafting his
own philosophies upon the poet's
creation, or an ambitious mime who
attempts it only as the part which
pays best when successful, our own
ideal of the noble Dane, and intimate
acquaintance with his real
being, save his representative from
entire failure. He is more to us
than any actor; and it is scarcely
going too far to say that,as each
new attempt is made, the universal
curiosity and interest it excites are
drawn forth at least quite as much
by the hope that now at last we
may know our Hamlet better, as by
the lighter and more superficial
eagerness to see how the actor acquits
himself in a great part. No
other tragic creation, however great,
has the same hold upon us. Othello
is noble and terrible in his mingled
strength and weakness, and Lear
tears our hearts asunder with a
passion of painful and tragic delight;
but Hamlet stands to us in
a far closer relation — 
he is a part
of our intellectual training ,of our
higher being, of all the mysteries
that move within us, and so often
burst into unconscious expression
in his very words. How it should
be so we cannot tell — for it is impossible
to conceive a type less like
the ordinary estimate of English
character; yet we feel assured the
reader will agree with us when we
say, that no other creation of poetry
has ever seized hold upon and
entered into the soul of the nation
with such complete and perfect
sovereignty. No hero of history — no
brave and resolute Englishman —
no King Hal, gay in his excesses,
noble in his transformation, the very
type of Anglo - Saxon manliness — comes within a thousand miles
of that mystic traveller between
life and death, that impersonatio nof
all the doubts and questionings of
humanity, in the heart of a people
which has no turn for philosophy, a
race prompt and ready, and more
apt at blows than words. Rarely
has there happened in the mental
history of a country so rare a phenomenon.
And we know no parallel
to it in any other national
experience, unless it were in Spain,
where, however, the long lean figure
of that forlorn and last knight errant
has too much humour in the
atmosphere that surrounds it,and
too much mixture of the ludicrous,
to hold the same position. The
German Faust makes no such universal
claim upon the sympathies,
and the French Alceste is but a
weakened shadow of Hamlet; while
in all these great conceptions there
is something which chimes in with
the national temper of the race
that has produced them. The
Spaniard's hyper-chivalry, the German's
wild yet carnal mysticism,
the Frenchman's bitter distinctness
of perception and cynic-sentimental
tendency, are all more or less embodied
in these central figuresof
their literature. But that we, who
pride ourselves upon our national
energy and practical character, and
whose faith it is that "if it were
done when 'tis done, then 'twere
well it were done quickly," — that
we should have selected Hamlet from
among all the poetical creations in
which we are so rich, as the object
of our unanimous interest, is one of
the strangest facts in literary history.
It would be incredible, were
it not absolutely true.<br>
This reign of Hamlet over the
English imagination comes from
time to time to a sudden climax,
by means of some new or powerful
actor;
and we are at presentmin the
midst of one of those high tides of
popular interest. Mr Irving is doing
what all his great predecessors
on the stage have done, with varying
power and success; and as it
is now a long time since any actor
has attempted perseveringly to win
this crown of reputation, the effort
is all the more interesting. The
last attemptof the kind, and indeed
the only one which comes within
our own experience of the stage,
was that made by Fechter more
than a dozen years ago. We do
not ourselves sympathise with the
feeling which makes some people
refuse their suffrage to an admirable
and accomplished actor,because his
English was somewhat defective.
This is one of the criticisms which
are becoming more and more general
among us, and which dwell
upon external and minute detail, in
entire indifference to the spirit and
soul of the performance. Fechter
has fallen out of fashion. Perhaps
he never did secure the critics so
completely on his side as he did the
simple multitudes who used to hang
on his lips;
but at all events it requires
courage now to produce his
name, in face of the superciliously
indulgent smile with which it is received
by those who are supposed
to know. Fechter's Hamlet, however,
was, we are bold to say, the
most interesting piece of acting
which we have ever seen;
and his
English can hardly be said to have
been more defective than that which
Mr Irving has managed to make the
public accept as a possible rendering
of Shakespeare's noble tongue.
But few things could be more
unlike than the breadth and ease
of the great French actor's treatment,
and the laborious and infinitely
painstaking effort of the
Hamlet who is at present in possession
of the stage. It is impossible,
we suppose, without some touch of
genius,to have attained the mastery
over the public which Mr Irving
undoubtedly possesses. In this age
of burlesques and dramatic folly,
he has gained the complete and absorbed
attention, night after night,
of a large and highly cultivated
audience, and succeeded in moving
societyin London to an almost
universal interest in every new attempt
he makes -- which is no small
triumph. Our own opinion, however,
is, that this remarkable actor
has attained his successes more by
sheer force of character than by
genius. He has conquered the
public by his bow and his spear
-- by means of the intense feeling and concentrated energy of
mind with which, it is evident,
he approaches his work --- labouring
at it like an athlete of Michael
Angelo, with every muscle starting
and every sinew strung to its
utmost tension. He is in such
deadly earnest in everything he
does that we can scarcely refuse our
interest to the effort which costs so
much. And as difficulty overcome
is universally recognised as a very
high attraction to human curiosity
and interest,there must always be
a large section of mankind to whom
the sightof the struggle by which
that difficultyis overcome will
always be more impressive and
affecting than the success which
looks easy, the calm mastery of the
greater artist who fights and strains
too in his time, but that not in,
but out of, sight of the gazing
crowd. This is not Mr Irving's
way : he takes the public into his
confidence,and shows them the
beads of toil upon his forehead, the
quiver in his limbs of muscular
and nervous as well as mental exertion.
It is something like a
gladiator that we have before us,
"taking arms"
as says our Shakespeare,
with that confusion of
metaphor at which we laugh tenderly,
liking him the better,supreme
master, for the slip that
proves him human ---
"against a sea
of troubles," facing all the wild
beasts of difficulty, and rending his
way to the prizew hich the excited
spectators accord him, almost more
for the pluck and force and energy
with which he has toiled for it,
than for the excellence of the perfomance.
The people who crowd
the Lyceum every night have thus,
if not a first-raterepresentation of
Hamlet, yet a very interestin gand
even exciting spectacle set before
them --- the sight of an able and
eccentric mind full of contortions,
yet also of strength, struggling with
all the power nature has given it,
upward to the platform of genius,
with every faculty strained, and its
whole being quivering in the effort.
There are those who mount to that
platform lightly, by grace of nature,
or seem to do so;
but these,
if finer and higher, are perhaps
in reality less interesting than the
indomitable fighter who struggles
upward to it, his teeth set, his
shoulders squared, his every limb
in energetic action. Mr Irving in
this pointof view presents a spectacle
to gods and men of which it is
difficult to exaggerate the interest.
He has almost every quality which
šshould interest the lookers-on — a
fine and generous aim, a high courage,
and the most determined tenacity
of purpose. If he cannot scale
these heights, we may be sure he
will die half-way, always fighting
upwards, never giving in. He is
in a hundred perils every day, and
nothing daunts him, — perils of
nature, perils of excessive friendship,
perilsof success — sometimes
the worst of all. Yet every step
he has made, even when we cannot
admire it, we are obliged to
recognise as an honest endeavour
towards that which is best
and highest. So far as can be
judged from without, never man
was more perfectly sincere or strenuous
in his determination to do
well. It is more than an artistic
effort,it is a moral conflict with adverse
powers of nature in which he
is engaged;
and if he fails in the
end, his failure will be from no
fault of his, no want of zeal or conscience
or energy in the man. One
does not generally use such words
in respect to an actor's study of his
part; but it is the highest testimonial
that can be given to Mr
Irving to say that we are obliged
to employ them after witnessing his
evening's work. <br>
Notwithstanding what has been
said of the unanimity of English
feeling in respect to Hamlet, there
is, perhaps, no dramatic creation in
the world about which there has
been so much difference of opinion.
Naturally the great mass of readers
and spectators make no attempt to
analyse it at all. The greatness of
the mind presented before them,
the consciousness of a human being
most real and tangible, though
looming over them with a confused
greatness which they can appreciate
without being able to understand
it, is enough to satisfy all their
intellectual requirements; though
even in this widest circle, the question
whether Hamlet's madness was
assumed or real will arouse a certain
intellectual interest. But above
the first level of the admiring and
uncritical public there are many
circles of critics, each of which has
its spoken or unspoken creed in regard
to Shakespeare's great creation.
There is scarcely a drawing-room
party among the educated classes in
which, were the question mooted,
there would not be found warm
partisans on both sides of the question,
and inquirers with ideas of
their own as to the real cause of
that vacillation, which is the most
obvious feature in the character to
the ordinary observer. We might
perhaps ask, though without any
possibility of reply, whether the
poet himself had any intention of
making this mystery clear to us;
or whether, indeed, it was within
the range of his genius to fathom
altogether the great and mysterious
being — greater and more wonderful
by far than the Warwickshire yeoman's
son, the playwright of the
Globe — whom he put miraculously
into the world to live there for ever,
outlasting a hundred generations of
men. This, however, is a view
which critics never, and the humble
reader very rarely, consent to
take. That mystic independence of
its creator which belongs to a great
poetical conception of character, reflecting,
perhaps, more truly than
anything else can, our own mortal
independence(so far at least as consciousness
goes) of our Maker, and
power to contradict, and, as much as
in us lies thwart, His purposes, is
incredible to most people. To our
own thinking, it is plain enough that
a dramatic conception of the highest
order does follow a law of its own
being which is not, as we think,
entirely under the control of its
originator. "I did not do it; they
did it themselves," Thackeray(we
think)is reportedto have said of
some of his heroes and heroines
whose proceedingsdid not please
the world; and the merest dabbler
in fiction must be aware of a curious
current of influence not originated
by him which sweeps the
personages of his story here and
there, following some necessity of
their nature which he may not even
comprehend, and which does not
agree with his plan for them. We
do not mean to imply an opinion
that Hamlet escaped from the control
of the poet to whom he owes
his birth ;
but only that so great a
creation might well have, like an
actual being, many doubtful and
unresolved points in him, over
which spectators might discuss,
without any absolute certainty,
even on the part of his maker, as
to which party was in the right.<br>
To ourselves Hamlet is the greatest
instance of that disenchantment
which is,of all the miseries in the
world,the one most crushingand
most general. Disenchantment —
desillusionment — that opening of
the eyes to see a world altogether
different from the world we have
observed, which is about the bitterest
pang of which the soul is capable.
It is the burden more or less
of all the world's worst complaints.
The common mass of us encounter it
in detail,and have happily managed
to weave some new veil over the
painful reality in one region before
we are caught in another,and obliged
to look on and see the veils of
imagination stripped from the facts
of life. And no one can bear to
dwell upon this unveiling. It
brings madness or it brings death;
or in the case of a noble mind too
great for such brief and vulgar conclusion,
it evolves a Hamlet — a man
standing among the wrecks of life
so deeply amazed, so confounded
and heart-struck,that his trouble
paralyses him, and nothing seems
worth doing of all that might be
done. Such a one in real life, we
may perhaps say, was Leopardi,
though without that spring of
sweeter nature in him which kept
Hamlet in being. In the case of
the real man, we do not know what
it was which turned all the milk
to gall,and brought the spirit face
to face with a universe of hideous
folly and falsehood, instead of that
world all dressed in smiles and
sweetness in which he had taken
delusive delight. The worst and
most dismal depth of the philosophical
despair which is called
pessimism, was the natural issue
with the Italian of that poisoning
of all happier impulse. What it
was in the royal Dane we all know. <br>
Hamlet is greater, larger than Leopardi;
his nature would, we cannot
doubt, have righted itself one time
or other, had it not been so precipitately
cut short: but there is a
certain illumination in the contrast
yet resemblance. The terrible gulf,
unlighted by any star, into which
Leopardi plunged at the moment
of which all his poems are full,
the point of life at which he awakened,
and at which, as he tells us,
the supreme delusion of his first
happier impressions became apparent
to him — has a profound
blackness of despair in it which
is less within the range of our
sympathies than the confused and
gloomy world, still in the throes
of earthquake, amid which Hamlet
stands, sick at heart, gazing with
eyes of wild dismay at the sanctities
which fall in succession into the
dust one after another, leaving him
ever more and more haggard and
bereaved. His father's death to be
revenged,and all that "cursed spite"
to be set right, are rather living influences
than otherwise to his soul,
bewildered with loss, and sick and
hopeless in the downfall of everything
that is sweet and fair around.
These motives keep up a struggle
within him, and in reality prevent
the gloomy waves from closing over
his head;
but yet have not acquired
the consistency of force necessary
to drive him back into living, and
into so much hope as would alone
make livingpossible. His vacillaton
is but the struggle of that
wholesome and righteous passion
against the inertness of despair,
the cui bono of his disenchanted
existence. He tries to rouse himself,
but in vain. What were
the good? If Claudius were slain,
would that restore honour and
purity to the desecrated house?
Could anything remake that polluted
mother into the type of holy
womanhood above corruption? He
tries to work himself up to the
point of action, but there is no
hope in him to give vigour to his
arm. Something of the old energy
bursts out in fits and starts, but is
paralysed by this supreme sickness
of heart and failure of all possibilities
of restoration. What Hamlet
wants is more than a vengeance: it
is a re-creation. Nothing short of
the undoing of all the monstrous
evil which has killed his soul in
him, is worth his living for. Mending
is futile, the harm is too fundamental,
the misery too complete.
Revenge would be a momentary satisfaction, would give him ease, as
when a wounded man tears off his
bandages; but what more could
revenge do for Hamlet? Restore
to him his world of youth, his
trust in those around him, his belief
that one is pure and another
true, his spotlessmother,his innocent
love, his loyal friends? — ah
no ! not one of them. And therefore,
now with flashes of wild scorn,
now with utterances of deepest sadness,
he stands —hesitating,— as we
say, before the vengeance which
will, he sees, be but a deception
like all the rest, and make no real
difference. Leopardi, the gloomy
shadow of an actual Hamlet, had no
possibility even of a stroke for life
in the shapeof a revenge, no palpabe
wrong which he could identify,
nor practical blow that would help
him a little, or which he could even
pretend might help him. Therefore
the nobility of a struggle is
wanting in him. More grandly,
on nobler lines,and with a more
majestic modelling, the poet has
worked out his fatally illuminated,
disenchanted, disappointed, heroic
soul. Let shallow Laertes storm for
his vengeance, but in the profound
depths of Hamlet's nature there is
no more room for delusion. As
Macbeth murdered sleep, so has
villany murdered truth,the soul of
the world; but that last and awful
murder is not to be made up for
by the death of the villain. That
is trivial, a nothing, a momentary
anodyne, a little salve put to the
burning of the heart-deep wound:
but no remedy; for remedy is beyond
possibility, beyond even hope.<br>
This in our opinion is the interpretation
of Hamlet, so far as his great
and noble manhood is capable of a
set interpretation. All through the
darkness that has closed round him
there strike flickerings of a former
light, which show the real nature,
instinct with grace and sweetness
of his character. When he is first
presented to us, his "inky cloak"
is not more new to him than is the
gloom that envelops his life. This
gloom dates back but these two
little months — not two: nay, perhaps
not more than half that
period: since the secret horrors that
lie beneath the surface of common
living first burst upon him — not in
his father's death, a natural sorrow,
but in the monstrous inconstancy
and wantonness of his mother. Before
that unparalleled revelation of
evil came, what had Prince Hamlet
been?<br>
 "The glass of fashion and the mould of form: <br>
The expectancy and rose of the fair state:"—<br>
the very hope and flower of noble
youth in Denmark. It is easy to
collect the traces of that light and
sweet existence after it is past. The
warmth of his faith in the one last
prop that remains to him, his faithful
Horatio, is at the first moment
scarcely less ready and genial than his
salutation of the other friends who
are not true: "Good lads,how do ye
both?" he cries, with happy frankness,
to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, before
he has seen the treachery
in their faces;
and when he has
begun to suspect that treachery, with
what pathos of recollection does he
remind them of the time in which
there was no suspicion, adjuring
them "by the rights of our fellowship,
by the consonancy of our
youth, by the obligation of our
ever-preserved love!" This is no
melancholy philosopher above the
range of the young cavaliers, the soldiers
and scholars of Wittenberg;
but a true comrade — one whose
superior rank made him only more
generous
in his brotherhood, more
dependent upon their affection.
And it is by means of the happy
likings of his youth that almost all
the machinery of the drama is constructed.
The players are brought
to him naturally, as to the source of
patronage and favour. They had
been of his retinue before, and he
knows each one, and has a gracious
word for the hobbledehoy who
plays the women's parts, as well as
for the leader of the troupe, whose
emotion at his own performance
fills the prince with a sad yet not
unamused wonder. If he had not
been their constant patron, and
known their capacity of old, the
expedient of the play could not
have come in. And the very climax
of the tragedyis procured by
similar means. Even in the midst
of his great gloom and overthrow,
Hamlet is still capable of being
piqued by the brag of Laertes' proficiency
in fencing, which proves
that such an accomplishment was
of price with him. But for this
there would have been no appropriateness
in the king's wager on
his head. It is "a very riband in
the cap of youth," part of "the
light and careless living" of the
blooming season. Strange words to
be applied to Hamlet! yet so true
that the skill of a rival has still
sufficient force to kindle the half-quenched
fire of youthful emulation
in him, notwithstanding all his burdens.
Last of all, there is the trifling
of early love — less love than fancy —
shaped upon the fantastic models of
the reigning fashion, which Hamlet
had not been too serious to play
with, like his contemporaries.The
letter which Polonius reads to the
king and queen is such a letter as
Sir Percie Shafton might have
written,the lightest traffic of lovemaking,
half sport, half earnest, —
all youthful extravagance and compliment.
"To my soul's idol, the
beautified Ophelia," — "an illphrase,
a very vile phrase," as Polonius
justly adds. This gay essay of gallntry
is precisely what Laertes
calls it in his early advice to his
sister, "a fashion and a toy in
blood;"
it is nothing more than
"the trifling of his favour." "Perhaps
he loves you now," the prudent
brother says;
but it is the
light fancy of youth, the inclination
of nature in its crescent, not any
guarantee for what may be when
"the inward service of the mind
and soul" has attained its full
width and growth. Still more decided
upon this point is Polonius.
"For Lord Hamlet, believe so much
in him that he is young," says the
wary old chamberlain. He has
been a dangerous young gallant, a
noble prince full of all the charms
and entertainments of his age; surrounded
by gay comrades, soldier
and courtier and scholar; ready for
every fresh amusement, to hear
everything new the players have on
hand,to try his skill against whoever
offers, to wear a fair lady's favour
in his cap. Such has been the
golden youth of the Prince of Denmark:
until suddenly, all at once,
as at the crack of doom, the mask
has broken off the fair face of the
world, and Hamlet has made the irredeemable
discoverythat nothing
is as it seems.<br>
It might be too long to attempt
to show how the foundations of the
world were more entirely broken
up by the special guise in which
this calamity overtook him, than
they could have been to Hamlet in
any other. There is indeed scarcely
any way in which the whole keynote
of nature could have been changed
to him except this. It could be done
to Othello by the supposed falsehood
of the woman in whom his life had
reblossomed, who was his consolation
for all the labours of existence;
but no falsehood of love could have
struck to despair the young man
only lightly stepping within the
primrose path of dalliance, and
capable of no tragic passion there.
Where he could be struck was in
the very fountain of his life — his
mother. The most degraded mind
finds a certain refuge there. A
woman by very right of maternity
is lifted out of the impurities and
suspicions which may assail even
those who are "as chaste as ice,as
pure as snow." She has a shield
cast before her to quench all evil
thoughts. If truth fails everywhere
else, yet in her there is the source,
the springs of unpolluted life, the
fountain of honour, the one original
type of faithful affection which cannot
be doubted, even if heaven and
earth were melting and dissolving.
While that foundation stands fast,
the world must still stand;
it cannot
fallinto irremediable ruin and
destruction. When Hamlet first
comes before us in "the customary
suit of sober black," which is in
itself a protestation against that
unnatural marriage, this entire revolution
of heaven and earth has
happened to him. He is dragged
in the train of the pageant, witnessing
his mother's re-enthronement,
looking on at all the endearments
of her monstrous bridehood,
sick with disgust and misery, unable
to turn his back upon it all, or
save himself from the dishonour
that invades his own veins from
hers. "Fie on't! 0 fie!" he cries,
with a loathing which involves all
the world, and even himself, in its
sick horror. The earth is <br>
<br>
"An unweeded garden,<br>
That grows to seed; things rank, and gross in nature, <br>
Possess it merely." <br>
<br>
Foulness is everywhere. Oh that
he could but melt and dissolve
away — that it could be permitted to
him to be no longer, to get done
with the very consciousness of living.
"Heaven and earth!" he
cries, in the impatience of his
wretchedness, "must I rememember" — <br>
<br>
"Within a month,— <br>
Let me not think on't." Frailty,thy name is woman! <br>
A little month ; or ere those shoes were old, <br>
With which she follow'd my poor father's body, <br>
Like Niobe, all tears; why she, even she, — <br>
0 God ! a beast,that wants discourse of reason,<br>
Would have mourned longer." <br>
<br>
This horrible revelation of evil
in the place where it should have
been least suspected, this certainty
which nothing can change or excuse
or atone for, is the foundation
of all that follows. The
murder is less, not more than this.
It may be proved,it may be reevnged,
and in any case it gives a
feverish
energy to the sufferer, an
escape for the moment from a deeper
bitterness still; but even were
it disproved or were it avenged, it
would change nothing. The worst
that can happen has happened; that
first discovery which makes every
other possible has been made. How
it is gradually supplemented by
other treacheries, and how the noble
victim finds himself surrounded by
every cheat that is most appalling
to his nature, all chiming in, with
one baseness after another, is in our
judgment the real argument of the
tragedy — ending as it does in an
imbroglio of heaped falsehood upon
falsehood, confusion of murderous
lie on lie ,which leads to the only
end that is possible — an end of universal
slaughter, embodying at once
the utter success and failure of multiplied
treachery, not capableof stopping
when it would. The murder is
brought into the foreground, arresting
the attention of the spectator,
holdingthe chief place for a time,
then utterly disappearing during the
last act as if it had not been — because
it is, in fact, not the central
strain of the drama at all, but only
a tremendous complication giving
life and temporary vigour to the
hero's terrible illumination and
despair. <br>
Let us endeavour to trace this
under-swell of dark and accumulating
misery through the play.
Hamlet is, in fact, roused into
heroic action whenever the question
of his father's murder is really
before him: he vacillates about
his vengeance; but in the great
scenes with the ghost, the arrangements
for the players, and also the
interview with his mother, there
is neither hesitation nor weakness
about him. It is when outside the
range of that inspiring excitement
that the darker misery seizes possesion
of his soul; and this we
think we shall be able to show.
As for the madness which he has
declared it to be his intention to
simulate, we see very little of that
on the stage or in the text. We
are left to infer that he must
have carried out his own suggestions
of policy ("I perchance hereafter
may think meet to put an
antic dispositionon "), by the fact
that immediately after the scene
with the ghost (in which there is
certainly no madness) we plunge
almost at once into the talk of the
court about "Lord Hamlet's lunacy."
This appears to have developed
so gradually,as to have left the
king and queen time to send to Wittenberg
for Rosencrantz and Guildenstern;
but the only evidence we
have of it is the report which the
frightened Ophelia brings to her
father of the strange visit the
prince has paid her as she was
"sewing in her closet." Ophelia,
to judge by the admonitions of her
relatives, had not been by any
means disinclined to admit the
wooing of Hamlet. "You have
of your audience been most free
and bounteous,"says her father "
a prudent man though an ambitious: — <br>
<br>
"From this time <br>
Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence; <br>
Set your entreatment at a higher rate <br>
Than a command to parley." <br>
<br>
The simple and submissive girl,
most shallow of all Shakespeare's
women — who is, throughout her
brief career before us, entirely unconscious,
it is evident, of any
claim of loyalty in love, and who
thinks a great deal more of her
father's approbation than of what
is due to Hamlet — gives us in reality
the only thing that approaches
to evidence of madness on his part.
"O my lord,my lord,I have been
so affrighted!" she cries,rushing
with a child's simple impulse to
her father. <br>
<br>
"Lord Hamlet, " with his doublet all unbrac'd; <br>
No hat upon his head ; his stockings foul'd, <br>
Ungarter'd,and down-gyved to his ankle; <br>
Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other, <br>
And with a look so piteous in purport, <br>
As if he had been loosed out of hell, <br>
To speak of horrors," he comes before me. <br>
Pol. Mad for thy love? <br>
Oph. My lord,I do not know; <br>
But, truly,I do fear it. <br>
Pol. What said he? <br>
Oph. He took me by the wrist, and held me hard: <br>
Then goes he to the length of all his arm; <br>
And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow, <br>
He falls to such perusal of my face, <br>
As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so; <br>
At last, — a little shaking of mine arm, <br>
And thrice his head thus waving up and down, <br> 
He raised a sigh so piteous and profound, <br>
As it did seem to shatter all his bulk, <br>
And end his being: that done, he lets me go; <br>
And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd, <br>
He seem'd to find his way without his eyes; <br>
For out o' doors he went without their help, <br>
And, to the last, bended their light on me." <br>
<br>
Curiously enough, this is the only
single bit of evidence in the whole
play which, we venture to say,
would be received by any court as
proof of Hamlet's madness. His
own light and bitter "chaff" with
Polonius would take in no lawyer.
Whether it might be that in the
interval which takes place behind
the scenes, Hamlet had perceived
that the sweet, childish nature of
Ophelia had been taken possession
of by the old courtier,and that she
was a real, if innocent,snare for him,
it is hard to tell;
but it is scarcely
possible for the reader to imagine
a delusion more absurd than that
the greatand princely Hamlet had
gone mad for the love of Ophelia.
Though her pretty simplicity and
hapless fate give a factitious interest
to her, it is manifest that this soft
submissive creature, playing into
her father's hands as she does, is in
no way a possible mate for Hamlet;
neither does he say a word which
would justify us in thinking that
any serious passion for her increased
the confusion of painand misery in
his mind. Perhaps that long perusal
of her face, of which she tells
her father, was the regretful, tender
leave-taking of the man from whom
all toys and fashions of the blood
had fallen away, who could write
sonnets no longer, nor rhymes to his
lady's eyebrow. Anyhow, the fact
remains that during the time which
elapsed between Hamlet's resolution
to "put an antic disposition on,"
and the arrival of Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern at the request of the
king, the events upon which the
notion of Hamlet's madness has
been built had taken place, and
that all we know of them is this
report of Ophelia's. He has, it
would appear, "borne himself
strange and odd," as he said he
would do, and Polonius has found
out the reason on his side,and
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern have
been sent for to do it on theirs
When Hamlet appears to us again, he
is mocking Polonius with wild talk
 — talk so full of meaning and mischief,
that even the old chamberlain
with his foregone conclusion in his
head, is fain to give vent to the
confession, "though this be madness,
yet there's method in't."
This transparent assumption of
folly blows off the moment he sees
the new-comers, whom he meets at
first with the frankest pleasure.
"Sure I am, there are not two men
living to whom he more adheres,"
the queen has said;
and the reception
which Hamlet gives them fully
carries out his mother's description.
But either there is something in
their air which prompts suspicion,
or the new-born doubts in his mind
make him question closely," What
make you at Elsinore?"
Alas ! the
generous and truthful Hamlet has
now got that light of bitter illumination
in his eyes which sees through
all disguises. In a little keen
quick play of persistent question
and unwilling reply, he has got the
secret of their mission. He accepts
that too: his friends have fallen
away from him, and turned into
spies and emissaries of his foe. The
rest of the interview with these
false friends is wrought with the
most marvellous skill: the suppressed
passion in it mingled with
that levity of the sick heart which
is more sad than despair. At first
he seems to make almost an appeal
to their sympathies, when he tells
them how he has "lost all my
mirth,foregone all custom of exercises;"
but seeing this does not
move one spark of the old fellow feeling within
them, Hamlet accepts
the position, this time with a smile
of bitter yet tranquil understanding.
That which would have been
so great an evil, so miserable a disaster
before — what is it now but a
faint echo of the downfall already
accomplished? Fate having already
done her worst, this bitterness the
more but chimes in like an anticipated
refrain. Yet the pain of it
tells even in the greater anguish,
and rises to a climax of indignant
remonstrance when, after the hypocritical
appeal his false friends make
to his old affection, Hamlet, scorning
to give them more distinct reply,
takes the "recorder" from the hands
of the player and offers it first to
one, then to the other. "Will you
play upon this pipe?" he says; — 'tis
as easy as lying: govern these
ventages with your ringers and
thumb, give it breath with your
mouth, and it will discourse most
eloquent music." "Why, look
you, now," he adds, "how un worthy
a thing you make of me!
You would play upon me; you
would seem to know my stops;
you would pluck out the heart of
my mystery... 'Sblood,do
you think I am easier to be played
on than a pipe?" Mr Irving in
a fury — quite out of character, we
think, with the concentrated scorn
and pain, the pang yet smile of the
outburst which is far too sad for
passion — breaks violently across his
knee the "little organ," which
appears to those shallow deceivers
so much more difficult to understand
than Hamlet's great heart
and nature. But passion or violence
is not in the contrast between
the simple pip eand the man's soul.
It leaves them confounded, poor
creatures as they are — yet still not
altogether sure, so great is the forbearance
of his protest, notwithstanding
the reluctant contempt in
it — that they may not yet deceive
him again, and get the better of
him, and worm their way into his
secret. In no part of the play is
his attitude more noble — high as the
heavens above the falsehood which
is wringing his very heart, yet
deeply, profoundly conscious of it
than in those scenes. His first disenchantment
has been so complete,
and has cut the ground so entirely
from under his feet, that this is no
new revelation to him. He bears
it even, standing there alone, on so
much solid ground as his feet can
cover, no more, with a smile — but
the smile is one of utter and inexpressible
pain. <br>
There remains but one thing in
which Hamlet might still find a
shred of truth and faithfulness.
According to our opinion Ophelia
has always been too slight and
small a creature to have much hold
upon such a spirit — and his perpetual
gibesa nd flouts at Polonius,
specially on the subject of his
daughter, would be cruel, had he
not an idea that some plot or
other in respect to his daughter
was brewing in the old courtier's
mind;
but when the deepest musings
of his sadness are disturbed by
the entrance of that last and cruellest
spy upon him, Hamlet does not
seem at first to contemplatethe possibility
that Ophelia too might be in
the plot against him. Her evidently
concerted appearance at that moment,
a calculated chance to secure
the prince's attention, rouses him
from thoughts so different that
he perceives her with a passing
impatience. And it is hard to
believe that even Ophelia is conscious
of the full meaning of the
snare which she is made to set.
Something of simplicity, something
of stupidity, is in the device — which
is probably all her own, and unsuggested by
the other conspirators —
of bringing Hamlet's love-tokens
to restore to him at such a moment
and under such circumstances.
Though she thinks he is mad of
love for herself, and though she
knows that her father and the king
are lying in watch to listen, she
tempts her crazed lover, as she
imagines,to betray his most secret
feeling, by those soft reproaches,
which at another place and time
would have been so affecting — appeals
to his tenderest recollections,
and pathetic protest against his
abandonment of her. A woman
forsaken could not do more in a
supreme effort to reclaim the heart
that has strayed from her. Her
faltering reference to the "words of
so sweet breath composed as made
the thing smore rich," the faint and
plaintive indignation of her conclusion,
"Rich gifts wax poor, when
givers prove unkind," would be exquisitely
touching did we not know
of those spies behind the arras.
They are exquisitely touching, we
believe, to the great part of the
public, who, soft-hearted to the soft
Ophelia,forget that this whole
meetingis a plot, and that she has
contrived, in her simplicity, a still
more delicate refinement of the
snare, by thus throwing upon him
the sudden shadow of the past.
For a moment Hamlet seems to
pause.
" I humbly thank you,
well, well, well," he says, in answer
to her question, with something in
his tone of fear, lest this softness
should melt him, and his steps be
tempted into a way less rude and
terrible than that which lies before
him. But when the meaning of the
whole situation suddenly flashes
upon him — when his rapid glance
detects the listeners at one side,
while the seeming-simple maiden
falters forth her reproaches on
the other — a blaze of sudden
scorn and wrath suddenly illuminates
the scene. A stab delivered
by so soft a hand cuts to the heart.
She too, suborned by his enemies,
made into a trap for him, endeavouring
to seduce him to a self betrayal more
intimate, more sacred,
than any that his false friends
could hope to attain! The pang is
so keen that Hamlet is cruel and
terrible to the soft and shrinking
creature. He rails at her as if she
were a wanton, and crushes her
under his contempt. "Go thy
ways to a nunnery — to a nunnery
— go!" he cries, with, for the first
time, a shrill tone of anger in his
voice. She to whose orisons he
commends himself one moment, is
denounced the next in terms as
harsh and disdainful as were ever
used to the most abandoned sinner.
His words beat her down
like a hailstorm on a flower. He
has no pity — no mercy. That combination
of the last appeal to his
tenderness with the concealed and
cruel plot against him betrays
Hamlet to an outburst which under
less provocation would be unmanly.
He insults the woman who has
made a snare for him out of her
own very tenderness. The exquisite
art which keeps up our
sympathy for the bewildered and
crushed Ophelia, notwithstanding
what would be the baseness of her
disloyalty were she sufficiently elevated
in character to understand
the treacherous part she is playing,
is wonderful. It leaves a haze of
mortal uncertainty about her character
altogether, such as veils the
actual being of our contemporaries,
and leaves us at liberty to think
better or worse of them according
to the point of view from which
we see them, — a licence which has
secured for Ophelia a place among
Shakespeare's heroines which does
not seem to be justified by anything
but the prettiness and pathos
of her mad scenes. Her submissive
obedience to every impulse from her
father scarcely balances her absolute
want of perception of any truth
or delicacy which she owes to
Hamlet, for whose betrayal she allows
herself,without apparent resistance,
to be made the decoy. <br>
Thus the last blow that Fortune
can now strike at him has fallen —
his friends have abandoned him;
his simple love,the innocent creature
in whom, if no lofty passion
was possible, there still seemed
every commendation to sweet domestic
trust and truth, has done her
best to betray him. What remains
for this man to whom all the world
has turned traitor, under whose feet
the solid soil has crumbled, who
sees nothing but yawning ruin
round him, abysses of darkness,
bottomless pits of falsehood, wherever
he may turn? <br>
This, it seems to us, is the deepest
and chief strain in the tragedy.
The murder and the vengeance he
would take for it, would his sick
heart leave him enough possibility
of living to give the necessary
standing-ground for the blow — form
the sole source of energy and life
which he retains. That cruel and
monstrous wrong, for which he can
yet get some amends, rouses him
from the deadly collapse of every
hope and wish which he cannot
escape, which nothing in heaven or
earth can remedy. The passion of
the great scene with the ghost
brings before us another Hamlet,
a heroic figure, altogether awakened
out of the sick and miserable musing,
the impotent still anger and pain
of his previous appearance.
"Remember
thee?" he cries;
"ay, thou
poor ghost, while memory holds a
seat in this distracted globe."
And the wild humour of his excitement
as he makes his companions swear to secrecy, is not
more unlike the bitter satire of
hopeless despondency with which
in a previous scene he explains his
mother's marriageas
"thrift, thrift,
pure thrift" — than is the roused
and passionatefervour of his action
from the apathy of spectatorship in
which we have seen him plunged
from the first. Again, the gleam
of revival which occurs when the
players present themselves, and
he perceives a ready means in his
hand of convicting the criminal,
confirming the apparition, and striking
a first and subtle blow, once
more restores force and life to Hamlet.
There is no vacillation in his
measures then. How prompt, how
ready, how practical are all his combinations!
Once more he is delivered
from the deadly influence
of that eating falsehood, and truth
becomes possible. <br>
<br>
"I have heard <br>
That guiltycreatures sitting at a play, <br>
Have by the very cunning of the scene <br>
Been struck so to the soul, that presently <br>
They have proclaim'd their malefactions. <br>
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak <br>
With most miraculous organ." <br>
<br>
After the terrible success of this
experiment, we are not left time to
see any further faltering of purpose.
The events follow in breathless
succession. The great scene with
his mother and the killing of Polonius
take place the same evening
— and that very night or the morning
immediately succeeding, without
pause or delay, he is swept away
to England on the expedition from
which the king hopes he may never
return. The " vacillation " with
which Hamlet is continually credited,
and of which so much has
been said, is all confined to the untold
period between the appearance
of the ghost and the point at which
the story resumes, with the treacheries
of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, and
of Ophelia. After he has
made sure by the trial to which he
subjects his uncle at the play, of the
guilt of the king, Hamlet, save at
the moment when he surprises the
criminal on his knees,and decides
not to kill him, has no further
opportunity for vacillation. And
here the sustained action of the tragedy
may be said to end. The last
act is a bewildering postscript, in
which all the mysteries of the previous
close and elaborate pieceof
tragedy are swept up. It might be
almost a new play, so different is it
— or the beginningof a continuation
which shows us all the former
occurrences thrown into distance
and perspective. Of the original
actors none remain except Hamlet
himself,the king and queen, and
the two lay figuresof Horatio and
Laertes. Ophelia is gone, all her
simplicities and artless treachery
ended in a pretty foolish madness
as much unlike the "lunacy of the
Lord Hamlet"
as can be conceived;
and old Polonius, wagging his wise
old head in shallow sagacity;
and
the young court friends, who cannot
understand their princely companion,
but can betray him — all are
swept away. And with them has
gone Hamlet's despair, and his plan
of vengeance, and all those obstinate
questionings with which he has endeavoured
to blow aside the veil of
human uncertainty. We tread new
ground, and enter a new contracted,
less impassioned world. <br>
All this time, though we have
discussed Hamlet much, we have
given but little attention to Mr
Irving, though it is his performance
which has furnished the text of the
disquisition. Notwithstanding the
very serious and conscientious perfomance
he gives us, it is very
difficult to judge what is the conception
he has formed of the character
of Hamlet. He would seem
rather to have studied the drama
scene by scene, endeavouring with
all his powers to give what seems to
him an adequate representation of
each, than to have addressed himself
to the character as a whole. And
though there are general criticisms
of the superficial kind to be addressed
to him, such as the very
natural and reasonable objection to
the language he speaks,which certainly
is quit eas imperfect English
as that which any foreigner may
have made use of — we are prevented
ed by our inability to discriminate
what his idea is, from finding any
fault with that idea. He wants
humour so entirely, that the wild
pathetic gleamsof diversion which
light up the gloom are lost to his
audience;
and the laugh which
breaks in at the most bitter moments
— that laugh which is full of
tears, yet is nevertheless instinct
with a wildlyhumorous perception
of thingsludicrous and incongruous
— loses all its distinctive character,
and becomes a mere hysterical
symbol of excessive emotion,
no more expressive than a shriek.
And he wants the flexibility, the
ready change from one mood to
another, the rapidity of transition
which bewilders Hamlet's commonplace
companions. The broken
jest, so strangely natural,yet to the
vulgar eye so unsuited to the occasion,
with which he hails the interruptions
of the ghost — his fantastic
fooling of Polonius — even the lighter
touches between deadly jest and
earnest with which his interview
with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
is full — are all beyond Mr Irving's
power. And the wild outburst of
tragic gaiety into which he breaks
when the assemblyis broken up
after the play, becomes mere mad
bellowing and screaming in Mr
Irving'shands, without any suggestion
of that wavering of the mind
at the very summit of tragic satisfction,
consternation, and horror,
frantic with meaning, yet a world
apart from madness, which is perhaps
the furthest step humanity
can take into what is expressible
and capable of being put into
words: it is a step beyond the
actor's powers. To embody the
vicissitudes, the extremes, the
heights and depths of this most
wonderful of poetical creations,who
could be sufficient who did not to
some degree share Hamlet's nature,
his large eyesight, his comprehension of small and great, his susceptibility
to every breath that flits
across the mental horizon? This
last qualityapparently Mr Irving
does not perceive at all;
for we are
sure that if he perceived it he
would devote himself to a study of
all the ripplings of sensitive faces,
all the transitions of changeable
minds. His own countenance is at
times finely expressive, but it has
not been made for the flickerings
of a mind at once spontaneous and
complex. Its force is single, uni,
not mingled but of one colour.
Hamlet is too great to be called
versatile, a word reserved by us
for the use of characters of slighter mould;
but there is all the gamut
in him, and no difficulty in going
at once from the height to the
depth of the moral scale. But Mr
Irving possesses no such varied
power of expression; and this must
always be fatally in his way when
it is necessary to attempt those
shades of meaning which are infinite,
and which vary with every
breath.
As an instance, however, of what
seems to us complete misconception
more serious than simple failure,
we may instance the scene with
Ophelia, which no doubt is one of
the most difficult in the play. It
is hard in any case (notwithstanding
that the doctrine is popular)
to give a persistent tone of
superiority to a man's intercourse
with a woman without offending
the finer perceptions as well as the
wholesome prejudices of the audience,
which naturally range themselves
on the woman's side; and it is
still more difficult to show the turn
of sentiment, and justify Hamlet's
wild and sudden onslaught upon so
soft and shrinking a nature. Mr
Irving avoids this by turning the
scene into one of the most impassioned
and frantic love — love of
gesture and attitude, since he can
not change the words, which are as
unlike love-making as ever were put
on paper. His Hamlet can scarcely
restrain himself from clasping
Ophelia to his heart, his arms are
all but closed around her, and
when he turns himself away it is
but to turn back, drawn by an
attraction which it takes not only
all his power of resolution but all
his muscular force to resist. Those
embracings of the air, those futile
snatchings and withdrawals,are supposed
to be proofs of a violent and
passionate love, restrained or broken
either by madness or by misery —
Mr Irving does not clearly give us
to understand which — but certainly
belonging at least to a most robust
sentiment, for even the sight of the
half-concealed spectators, about
whose presence it is impossible he
can deceive himself, makes no difference
to him; and he goes on
with those wild half-embraces and
the strangest pantomimic struggle
of passion after he knows of the
plot and treachery, making an exhibition
of his feelings under the
very noses of the watchers. From
whence Mr Irving can have taken
this extraordinary conception is
impossibleto tell. It is contradicted
not only by every word
Hamlet says, but by the verdict of
the spies after. "Love! his affections
do not that way tend," says
the king, more clear-sighted than
Mr Irving; though, indeed, had
Mr Irving been Hamlet (as,thank
heaven! he is not), Polonius must
have remained master of the field,
since nothing could justify his mad
behaviour but the old courtier's
theory. There are many jarring
notes in the performance, but none
so entirely false as this. <br>
On the equally delicate ground
where Hamlet is confronted by the
other treachery in the persons of
Guildenstern and Rosencrantz, Mr
Irving i smuch more happy. Though
he is incapableof the light banter
which conceals so much tragic feeling,
his intercourse with them is well
done throughout, though somewhat
extreme in gravity. The searching
look,which is the firstevidence
of his doubts, follows very quickly
upon his cordial recognitionof his
fellow-students;
and the manner in which he penetrates through their
shifting and paltry defences is fine
in its reality and concentrated observation
— a study as successful as
the encounter with Ophelia is false.
In the one case he has caught the
true tone of the character, in the
other goes wilfully against it, and
againstevery indication of the text.
The fine scene with the recorder, to
which we have already referred, is
somewhat spoiledby the violence
with which he breaks, when he has
served his purpose, the pipe which
has proved so powerful an illustration
of his meaning;
but this is a detail
which may easily be pardoned,
all the rest being so satisfactory.
By the way, the introduction of the
recorder, not only in Mr Irving's
arrangement, but in every other we
have seen, is singularly artificial.
Hamlet has demanded "some music — the recorders," in his wild exultation
at the end of the play-scene,
meaning evidently a performance
of music to soothe or inspire his
excited fancy, or to take the place
of the entertainment so summarily
interrupted. The recorder,however,
is brought to him as if he
had asked for it simply to give
the courtiers their lesson, the idea
of music to be performed before
him failing altogether. Mr Irving's
careful zeal for all these matters
might well be exerted on this point
to make the introduction of the instrument
more natural. <br>
That he does not think any detail
trivial is apparent from his notes in
a contemporary, the last of which is
occupied with a defence of his own
practice in withdrawing the two
portraits of traditionary use, which
have hitherto figured in the queen's
chamber, and afforded a visible text
for Hamlet's speech —
"Look here,
upon this picture, and on this." Mr
Irving's crotchet on this point is
really unimportant; though it is
somewhat confusing, we think, to
the spectato, to have so distinct an
allusion without any visible ground
for it;
and the suggestion he makes,
that the stage has four walls, and
that the portraits may be supposed
to be hanging upon that which "is
only theoretical" — which, in reality,
is the theatre, with all its crowding
faces — is somewhat ludicrous. The
absence of the portraits, or of the
miniatures which sometimes do duty
for them, weakens the force of the
speech, in so far as any failure of
external accessories can weaken it,
which is a trivial quantity. But
this accessory to which the text
seems to point is, on the whole,
more important than the chamber candle
which Hamlet, with real attention,
lights and hands to his
mother at the conclusion of the interview,
neglecting, however, as we
cannot but feel, to remind her of
the night-gear, evidently airing at
the fire, which gives truth and local
colour to the room; though, after
all, it is not the queen's bedroom,
but only some boudoir appartenant,
or there would be no need for
the chamber-candle at all. The
scene which takes place in this
room is strangely lopped and cut;
something it may be necessary to
omit in deference to modern modesties,
but these are somewhat too
much regarded in a scene of passion
so intense. And the sudden vehemence
of Hamlet's action, when the
voice behind the arras rouses him
into wild rapidityof impulse, leaving
no time for thought, loses all
its force in Mr Irving's treatment.
He lifts the arras before he strikes,
making any doubt about the person
of the victim impossible, and
taking the meaning out of his own
question, "Is it the king?" It must be remembered that he has
come there still breathless with the
wild emotion of the play-scene;
that he has passed, on his way,
through the oratory where the king
is praying, and has spared him ;
and that the transport of sudden
passion with which he rushes at
the concealed spectator is a payment
of long arrears to the arch-enemy,
who had already used this
same mean device to surprise his
thoughts. We cannot tell why Mr
Irving should have cut out two
lines of the words addressed to the
dead Polonius, which are far from
unnecessary: <br>
<br>
"Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell! <br>
I took thee for thy better; *take thy fortune; <br>
Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger*" <br>
<br>
is what Shakespeare wrote; but
Mr Irving omits the italics, leaving
the victim without even so much
disdainful regret as this.
Altogether ludicrous, too, is the
appearance of the ghost in this very
important scene. The convolutions
of the queen's night-drapery, which,
so far as she is concerned, occupy the
most prominent place in the scene,
billowing hither and thither as she
is affected by Hamlet's vituperations,
had, we confess, so occupied
our mind, that when, with a rush,
a venerable gentleman in familiar
domestic costume came on the
stage, shaking it with substantial
footsteps, the idea of the ghost did
not present itself at all to our dull
imagination;
and it was impossible
to avoid the natural idea that the
lady's husband, hearing an unaccountable
commotion in the next
room, had jumped out of bed,
seized his dressing-gown, and
rushed in to see what was the
matter. The combination of this
and the chamber-candle which
Hamlet lights so carefully, and the
night-gown airing at the fire, is
most unfortunate. These accessories
are a great deal more prosaic
than the introduction of pictures
would be;
and we cannot but
wonder that the actor who leaves
so much to imagination at one
moment, should leave so little to
it at another.
There are many omissions, too,
which seem distinct faults in the representation,
diminishing its effect
— as, for instance, at the end of
the play-scene, where the alarmed
phrases exchanged by the spectators
occupy the moment necessary to
show us the king's perturbation,
before the whole train suddenly
rushes away, and everything is
over. Here is the version of Shakespeare: — <br>
"Ham. He poisons him i' the garden 
for's estate. His name's Gonzago: the 
story is extant, and writ in choice Italian. 
You shall see anon how the murderer gets 
the love of Gonzago's wife. 
*Oph. The king rises. <br>
Ham. What! frighted with false fire? <br>
Queen. How fares my lord? <br>
Pol. Give o'er the play.* <br>
King. Give me some light: — away! <br>
All Lights,lights,lights!" <br>
<br>
Mr Irving leaves out all that we
have put in italics, thus gaining
nothing in point of time,and entirely
missingthe confused consciousness
of the spectators, which
helps the effect of the scene so
greatly. As it is now beingrepre- sntd,
the king'sexclamation,and
the echoingcry of the courtiers for
lights,are all that is interposed
between the sudden flightof the
court and Hamlet's explanationof
the argument of the play. His
own outcry," What ! frightedwith
false fire1
"
is transposed,and comes
after the precipitatewithdrawal of
the royalparty. Thus the effect of
three independentwitnesses to th
king'sconviction and remorse, each
breakingin spontaneously,with a
risingexcitement which makes the
rush of the departureinfinitely more
tellingand lifelike,is entirelylost.
And no counterbalancingadvantage
is gainedby the omission of these
few but pregnant phrases,which do
not delaybut only elucidate the
action. We cannot understand,
either,why of Hamlet's wild dog- gerel
the verse which is universally
known and full of meaning,should
be omitted,while the second mad
rhyme is retained :
" Why, let the stricken deer go weep,
The hart ungalledplay,"
is as fit an expressionof the wild
feelingof the moment as could be
found " whereas the jinglethat is
retained is a mere maddening clat- ter
of words,expressiveenough of
the frantic levityof passionwhen
taken in conjunctionwith the other,
but far less worthyof preservation
than the other. We fail also to
perceiveany reason for leavingout
one of the best-known lines in the
Ghost's address to Hamlet, "Unhousel'd,disappointed,unanel'd."
Perhapsthere is no singleline in
the whole play the omission of
which would so strike the most
careless listener. It is like leaving
out a bar in a strain of music, and
withdraws our mind from the rest
of the speechinto involuntaryin- vestigation
of the mystery of this
incomprehensible" cut." Why, ex- cept
to make us stumble and dis- tract
our attention,should this have
been left out 1
The omission of the scene in the
oratory,the king'sprayer and Ham- let's
fierce and momentary self-dis- cusion
thereanent,is perhapsless
to be complainedof. We sincerely
sympathisewith Mr Irving in the
grievousdisappointmentshe must
encounter in the persons of his
kings.The Shakespearianmonarch
is a beingby himself;and how to
get him to look " not like a king,
but " like anythingbetter than a
hobby-horse,must be a labour of
Hercules such as only managers
fullyappreciate.It is much better
to leave the scene out altogether
than to associate only ludicrous
ideas with it. A gentlemanwhose
chief thought when he kneels is
about the knees of his " tights."
and who goes on serenelysaying
his prayers while the avenger rants
and waves a torch within a foot of
him, is better left out when he can
be left out. Indeed their majesties
of Denmark at the Lyceum must
be almost as greatan exercise to Mr
Irving'ssoul as were their originals
to Hamlet. The swingof their re- spective
mantles,especiallythat fine
wave of white silk liningfrom the
monarch's shoulder,isthe chief point
that strikes us. As for the queen,
the manner in which her majesty
swathes herself in her red and yellow
night-gownduringthe excitingscene
in her chamber,making its billows
and puffingsdo dutyfor the emo- tin
she shows but little trace of
otherwise,is probablydue to some
archaeologicalinstructions previous- ly
administered by Hamlet, rather
than to any inspirationof her own.
We cannot,however,pass over the
personnelof the drama without say- ing
somethingof Miss Ellen Terry's
Ophelia. No Opheliaof our time
has givento the character so grace- ful
a presence. The very excellence
of the actress,however,makes more
apparent the insignificanceof the
part allotted to her. Nothing can
make the submissive littledaughter
of Polonius a greatpoeticalheroine.
All the prejudicesof the audience
are in her favour,and we have
grown up with the idea that she
ranks among the Juliets and Rosa- linds
; and, unfortunately,it has
been very easy on most occasions
to assure ourselves that our disap-
pointment arose solelyfrom the in- capacity
of the actresses to whom
(anecessityfor a singingvoice be- ing
in itself a limitation to the
number of Ophelias possible)the
part was intrusted. But now that
we have a representativeto whom
no exception can be made, this
delusion fails us. Even Miss Terry
cannot givemore than the mildest
interest to the character. What
she can do she does ; though even
the sweet and animated archness
of her countenance, though capa- ble
of touching pathos,would be
more adaptedfor a Rosalind full of
life and action,than for the plain- tive
weakness of Ophelia.
The lastact of " Hamlet " remains
to ourselves a mystery. We can- not
attempt to discuss what we so
littleunderstand. Had not Shake- speare
been writing playsfor an
audience to which an orthodox
ending was necessary " had not
even the supreme creator laboured
under that necessityfor a third
volume with which critics upbraid
the smaller artists of fiction" it is
likelyenough that he would have
left this tale unfinished,as it is at
the end of the fourth act. There
is no end practicablefor such a
hero. Death indeed cuts the thread
artificiallyboth in real life and
poetry ; but it is an artificialend- ig,
however it comes about, and,
so far as we are concerned, solves
110 problem,though we make bold
to believe that it explainsevery- thing
to the person chieflycon-erned.
In the fifth act all is
changed. That former world has
rolled away with all its passions
and pains. Hamlet, having de- livered
himself by the promptest
energeticaction, in an emergency
which is straightforwardand with- ou
complications,comes back with a
languorand exhaustion about him
which contrasts strangelywith the
intensityof all his previouseino
tions. Contemplativeas ever, there
is no longerany strain of mystic
anguish in his musings. Unac- countably,
yet most evidently,the
greatness of his sufferinghas dis- solved
away. He walks into the
scene like a man recovered from an
illness" like one who has been
dreaming and is awake, a sadder
and a wiser man than he was only
yesternight. His speculationsin
the churchyardare all in a lower
key. Instead of those sublime
questioningsof earth and heaven
which formed the burden of all his
thoughts" instead of the passion
of disenchantment and cruel con- sciousness
of treacheryand false- hood
" the flightof his subdued
fancygoes no higherthan the base
uses to which the dust of humanity
may return. True, he starts into
spasmodic excitement when roused
by the rantingof Laertes over his
sister's grave, and meets him with
an outburst of responsiveranting,
in which there is a gleam of his old
wild humour, though subdued like
himself to a lower tone. " The
braveryof his griefdid put me into
a towering passion,"he exclaims
afterwards to Horatio ;
and his
sudden irritation and outdoing of
the swagger of his natural opponent
is the thing most like the Hamlet
of old in the whole postscriptalepi- sode.
So also in a mild degree is
the scene with the young euphuist
Osric,where prince and courtier
give us a dialoguein the manner
of Lyly, accordingto the fashion
of Elizabeth's time rather than
Hamlet's,wonderfullyreduced and
tamed from the wild and brilliant
play of the princewith Polonius in
the previousacts. Throughout the
growing rapidityof action with
which all thingstend towards the
catastrophe,Hamlet bears himself
with noble and unsuspiciousdig- nty
;
while the last murderous net- work
of deceit,which is compass-
ing his death, closes round him.
The hand of fate is upon him, his
insight is clouded with a great
weariness, his deep soul subdued.
It does not occur to him apparently
to ask why this
wager
of the king's,
or for what
purpose he, of all men
in the world, is backed
up
and set
forth as his champion by his nat- ural
enemy.
He walks this time
calmly, with melancholy grace,
into
the snare.
Thus Hamlet dies, as he has
suffered, by fraud. Treachery has
tracked him from the beginning of
the great and melancholy story.
It has broken his heart, it has
untwisted for him all the ties of
nature, it has made love and friend- ship
into delusions, and life itself
a troubled dream. What is the
secret of the subdued dead hush
and calm with which he comes
before us in the end? Is it mere
weariness, exhaustion of all possi- bility
of action, the sense that
nothing more remains worth strug- glin
for " for even his
revenge,
the one object which had kept
the channels of life clear, has dis- appeared
in the last chapter ? Who
can tell 1 only at the
very
end does
a gleam of the old passion flash
in his face, as he at last accom- plishes
that
vengeance,
and sends
his
enemy
before him into the land
of retribution. So far as our theory
goes,
the last act is in fact th
return of the poet to his real theme.
His hero has been wrecked through- out
by treachery. The higher be- trayals
that affected his heart and
soul wrun" Hamlet's being, and
transformed the world to him : but
the meaner tricks that assailed his
life were 1oo low for his suspicion.
How was he, so noble, so unfor- tunate,
measuring his soul against
the horrible forces of falsehood, the
spiritual wickedness in high places,
to come down from that impas- sioned
and despairing contest, to
think of poison, or take
precau- tions
against it? Thus the traitor
got the better of him, and death
triumphed at the last.
There is nothing to object to in
Mr Irving's performance of this last
portion of the play. It suits him
better than all that has
gone
before.
The anachronism which we believe
experts find in the exhibition of
a modern scientific manner of fenc- ing,
which could not have existed
in the
vague traditionary days of
Hamlet the Dane, is but a trifling
and scholarly grievance, and there
is no complication of passions to
carry
these scenes beyond the actor's
range.
If he would dispense with
the ludicrous head-dress which is
half like Mephistopheles and half
like a gipsy woman, we should
feel that Mr Irving's churchyard
scene was as satisfactory a render- ing
as we are likely to attain.
