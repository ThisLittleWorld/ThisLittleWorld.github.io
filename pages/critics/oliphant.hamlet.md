IT is common to say that no actor
upon the English stage, who has
any ambition or love for his profession,
can die happy without having
once at least attempted to represent
Hamlet. It is the part
which inspires the most imperfect,
and leads on the most experienced
in never-failing pursuitof an excellence
to come — a laurel always there
for the winning. It is, we are also
told by those who know the stage
well, although one of the most
difficult of all the creations of
poetry, the one also in which absolute
failure is less common than in
any other. No one, perhaps, of all
its many representativeshas given
us a complete impersonation of the
strange and wonderful being whom
we never completely understand,
whom we discuss and quarrel over
all our lives, but whom, at least, we
know, as we know few other of our
lifelong friends;
while at the same
time, every one who has attempted
the part has gotsome hold on humanity
through those words, which the
merest mouther of phrases cannot
spoil, and that most touching and
terrible position which, even when
we do not understand it, we feel,
moving us to the bottom of our
hearts. Whether it is a doctrinaire
who is upon the stage, grafting his
own philosophies upon the poet's
creation, or an ambitious mime who
attempts it only as the part which
pays best when successful, our own
ideal of the noble Dane, and intimate
acquaintance with his real
being, save his representative from
entire failure. He is more to us
than any actor; and it is scarcely
going too far to say that,as each
new attempt is made, the universal
curiosity and interest it excites are
drawn forth at least quite as much
by the hope that now at last we
may know our Hamlet better, as by
the lighter and more superficial
eagerness to see how the actor acquits
himself in a great part. No
other tragic creation, however great,
has the same hold upon us. Othello
is noble and terrible in his mingled
strength and weakness, and Lear
tears our hearts asunder with a
passion of painful and tragic delight;
but Hamlet stands to us in
a far closer relation — 
he is a part
of our intellectual training ,of our
higher being, of all the mysteries
that move within us, and so often
burst into unconscious expression
in his very words. How it should
be so we cannot tell — for it is impossible
to conceive a type less like
the ordinary estimate of English
character; yet we feel assured the
reader will agree with us when we
say, that no other creation of poetry
has ever seized hold upon and
entered into the soul of the nation
with such complete and perfect
sovereignty. No hero of history — no
brave and resolute Englishman —
no King Hal, gay in his excesses,
noble in his transformation, the very
type of Anglo - Saxon manliness — comes within a thousand miles
of that mystic traveller between
life and death, that impersonatio nof
all the doubts and questionings of
humanity, in the heart of a people
which has no turn for philosophy, a
race prompt and ready, and more
apt at blows than words. Rarely
has there happened in the mental
history of a country so rare a phenomenon.
And we know no parallel
to it in any other national
experience, unless it were in Spain,
where, however, the long lean figure
of that forlorn and last knight errant
has too much humour in the
atmosphere that surrounds it,and
too much mixture of the ludicrous,
to hold the same position. The
German Faust makes no such universal
claim upon the sympathies,
and the French Alceste is but a
weakened shadow of Hamlet; while
in all these great conceptions there
is something which chimes in with
the national temper of the race
that has produced them. The
Spaniard's hyper-chivalry, the German's
wild yet carnal mysticism,
the Frenchman's bitter distinctness
of perception and cynic-sentimental
tendency, are all more or less embodied
in these central figuresof
their literature. But that we, who
pride ourselves upon our national
energy and practical character, and
whose faith it is that "if it were
done when 'tis done, then 'twere
well it were done quickly," — that
we should have selected Hamlet from
among all the poetical creations in
which we are so rich, as the object
of our unanimous interest, is one of
the strangest facts in literary history.
It would be incredible, were
it not absolutel ytrue.
This reign of Hamlet over the
English imagination comes from
time to time to a sudden climax,
by means of some new or powerful
actor;
and we are at presentmin the
midst of one of those high tides of
popular interest. Mr Irving is doing
what all his great predecessors
on the stage have done, with varying
power and success; and as it
is now a long time since any actor
has attempted perseveringly to win
this crown of reputation, the effort
is all the more interesting. The
last attemptof the kind, and indeed
the only one which comes within
our own experience of the stage,
was that made by Fechter more
than a dozen years ago. We do
not ourselves sympathise with the
feeling which makes some people
refuse their suffrage to an admirable
and accomplished actor,because his
English was somewhat defective.
This is one of the criticisms which
are becoming more and more general
among us, and which dwell
upon external and minute detail, in
entire indifference to the spirit and
soul of the performance. Fechter
has fallen out of fashion. Perhaps
he never did secure the critics so
completely on his side as he did the
simple multitudes who used to hang
on his lips;
but at all events it requires
courage now to produce his
name, in face of the superciliously
indulgent smile with which it is received
by those who are supposed
to know. Fechter's Hamlet, however,
was, we are bold to say, the
most interesting piece of acting
which we have ever seen;
and his
English can hardly be said to have
been more defective than that which
Mr Irving has managed to make the
public accept as a possible rendering
of Shakespeare's noble tongue.
But few things could be more
unlike than the breadth and ease
of the great French actor's treatment,
and the laborious and infinitely
painstaking effort of the
Hamlet who is at present in possession
of the stage. It is impossible,
we suppose, without some touch of
genius,to have attained the mastery
over the public which Mr Irving
undoubtedly possesses. In this age
of burlesques and dramatic folly,
he has gained the complete and absorbed
attention, night after night,
of a large and highly cultivated
audience, and succeeded in moving
societyin London to an almost
universal interest in every new attempt
he makes -- which is no small
triumph. Our own opinion, however,
is, that this remarkable actor
has attained his successes more by
sheer force of character than by
genius. He has conquered the
public by his bow and his spear
-- by means of the intense feeling and concentrated energy of
mind with which, it is evident,
he approaches his work --- labouring
at it like an athlete of Michael
Angelo, with every muscle starting
and every sinew strung to its
utmost tension. He is in such
deadly earnest in everything he
does that we can scarcely refuse our
interest to the effort which costs so
much. And as difficulty overcome
is universally recognised as a very
high attraction to human curiosity
and interest,there must always be
a large section of mankind to whom
the sightof the struggle by which
that difficultyis overcome will
always be more impressive and
affecting than the success which
looks easy, the calm mastery of the
greater artist who fights and strains
too in his time, but that not in,
but out of, sight of the gazing
crowd. This is not Mr Irving's
way : he takes the public into his
confidence,and shows them the
beads of toil upon his forehead, the
quiver in his limbs of muscular
and nervous as well as mental exertion.
It is something like a
gladiator that we have before us,
"taking arms"
as says our Shakespeare,
with that confusion of
metaphor at which we laugh tenderly,
liking him the better,supreme
master, for the slip that
proves him human ---
"against a sea
of troubles," facing all the wild
beasts of difficulty, and rending his
way to the prizew hich the excited
spectators accord him, almost more
for the pluck and force and energy
with which he has toiled for it,
than for the excellence of the perfomance.
The people who crowd
the Lyceum every night have thus,
if not a first-raterepresentation of
Hamlet, yet a very interestin gand
even exciting spectacle set before
them --- the sight of an able and
eccentric mind full of contortions,
yet also of strength, struggling with
all the power nature has given it,
upward to the platform of,genius,
with every faculty strained,and its
whole beingquiveringin the effort.
There are those who mount to that
platform lightly,by grace of na- ture,
or seem to do so ;
but these,
if finer and higher,are perhaps
in realityless interestingthan the
indomitable fighterwho struggles
upward to it, his teeth set, his
shoulders squared,his every limb
in energeticaction. Mr Irvingin
this pointof view presentsa spec- tacle
to gods and men of which itis
difficult to exaggeratethe interest.
He has almost every qualitywhich
should interest the lookers-on " a
fine and generous aim,a high cour- age,
and the most determined ten- acity
of purpose. If he cannot scale
these heights,we may be sure he
will die half-way,always fighting
upwards, never givingin. He is
in a hundred perilsevery day,and
nothing daunts him," perilsof
nature, perilsof excessive friend- ship,
perilsof success " sometimes
the worst of all. Yet every step
he has made, even when we can- not
admire it,we are obliged to
recogniseas an honest endeav- our
towards that which is best
and highest. So far as can be
judged from without,never man
was more perfectlysincere or stren- uous
in his determination to do
well. It is more than an artistic
effort,it is a moral conflict with ad- verse
powers of nature in which he
is engaged;
and if he fails in the
end, his failure will be from no
fault of his,no want of zeal or con- science
or energy in the man. One
does not generallyuse such words
in respectto an actor's studyof his
part; but it is the highesttesti- monial
that can be given to Mr
Irving to say that we are obliged
to employ them after witnessinghis
evening'swork.
Notwithstandingwhat has been
said of the unanimity of English,
feelingin respectto Hamlet, there
is,perhaps,no dramatic creation in
the world about which there has
been so much difference of opinion.
.Naturallythe greatmass of readers
and spectatorsmake no attempt to
analyseit at all. The greatnessof
the mind presentedbefore them,
the consciousness of a human being
most real and tangible,though
loomingover them with a confused
greatnesswhich theycan appreciate
without being able to understand
it,is enough to satisfyall their
intellectual requirements; though
even in this widest circle,the ques- tion
whether Hamlet's madness was
assumed or real will arouse a cer- tain
intellectual interest. But above
the firstlevel of the admiringand
uncritical publicthere are many
circlesof critics,each of which has
its spokenor unspoken creed in re- gard
to Shakespeare'sgreatcreation.
There is scarcelya drawing-room
party among the educated classes in
which, were the questionmooted,
there would not be found warm
partisanson both sides of the ques- tion,
and inquirerswith ideas of
their own as to the real cause of
that vacillation,which is the most
obvious feature in the character to
the ordinaryobserver. We might
perhapsask, though without any
possibilityof reply,whether the
poet himself had any intention of
making this mystery clear to us;
or whether, indeed,it was within
the range of his genius to fathom
altogetherthe greatand mysterious
being" greaterand more wonderful
by far than the Warwickshire yeo- man's
son, the playwrightof the
Globe " whom he put miraculously
into the world to live there for ever,
outlastinga hundred generationsof
men. This, however, is a view
which critics never, and the hum- ble
reader very rarely,consent to
take. That mysticindependence
its creator which belongsto a great
poeticalconceptionof character,re- flecting,
perhaps,more trulythan
anythingelse can, our own mortal
independence(sofar at least as con- sciousness
goes)of our Maker, and
power to contradict,and,as much as
in us lies thwart,His purposes, is
incredible to most people. To our
own thinkingitis plainenoughthat
a dramatic conceptionof the highest
order does follow a law of its own
beingwhich is not, as we think,
entirelyunder the control of its
originator." I did not do it; they
did it themselves,"Thackeray(we
think)is reportedto have said of
some of his heroes and heroines
whose proceedingsdid not please
the world; and the merest dabbler
in fiction must be aware of a curi- os
current of influence not origi- nated
by him which sweeps the
personages of his storyhere and
there,followingsome necessityof
their nature which he may not even
comprehend,and which does not
agree with his planfor them. We
do not mean to implyan opinion
that Hamlet escapedfrom the con- trol
of the poet to whom he owes
his birth ;
but onlythat so greata
creation might well have, like an
actual being,many doubtful and
unresolved points in him, over
which spectatorsmight discuss,
without any absolute certainty,
even on the part of his maker, as
to which party was in the right.
To ourselves Hamlet is the greatest
instance of that disenchantment
which is,of all the miseries in the
world,the one most crushingand
most general. Disenchantment "
disillusionment " that opening of
the eyes to see a world altogether
different from the world we have
observed,which is about the bitter- est
pang of which the soul is cap- able.
It is the burden more or less
of all the world's worst complaints.
The common mass of us encounter it
in detail,and have happilymanaged
to weave some new veil over the
painfulrealityin one regionbefore
we are caught in another,and ob- liged
to look on and see the veils of
imaginationstrippedfrom the facts
of life. And no one can bear to
dwell upon this unveiling. It
bringsmadness or it bringsdeath ;
or in the case of a noble mind too
greatfor such brief and vulgarcon-lusion,
it evolves a Hamlet " a man
standing among the wrecks of life
so deeply amazed, so confounded
and heart-struck,that his trouble
paralyseshim, and nothingseems
worth doing of all that might be
done. Such a one in real life,we
may perhaps say, was Leopardi,
though without that spring of
sweeter nature in him which kept
Hamlet in being. In the case of
the real man, we do not know what
it was which turned all the milk
to gall,and broughtthe spiritface
to face with a universe of hideous
follyand falsehood,instead of that
world all dressed in smiles and
sweetness in which he had taken
delusive delight.The worst and
most dismal depth of the philo- sophical
despair which is called
pessimism, was the natural issue
with the Italian of that poisoning
of all happierimpulse. What it
was in the royalDane we all know.
Hamlet isgreater,largerthan Leo- pardi
;
his nature would,we cannot
doubt,have righteditself one time
or other,had it not been so preci-itately
cut short : but there is a
certain illumination in the contrast
yet resemblance. The terriblegulf,
unlightedby any star,into which
Leopardi plunged at the moment
of which all his poems are full,
the pointof lifeat which he awak- ened,
and at which, as he tellsus,
the supreme delusion of his first
happier impressions became ap- parent
to him " has a profound
blackness of despairin it which
is less within the range of our
sympathies than the confused and
gloomy world, still in the throes
of earthquake,amid which Hamlet
stands,sick at heart,gazing with
eyes of wild dismay at the sanctities
which fall in succession into the
dust one after another,leavinghim
ever more and more haggard and
bereaved. His father's death to be
revenged,and allthat "cursed spite"
to be set right,are rather livingin- fluences
than otherwise to his soul,
bewildered with loss,and sick and
hopelessin the downfall of every- thing
that is sweet and fair around.
These motives keep up a struggle
within him, and in realityprevent
the gloomy waves from closingover
his head ;
but yet have not acquired
the consistencyof force necessary
to drive him back into living,and
into so much hope as would alone
make livingpossible.His vacil- lton
is but the struggleof that
wholesome and righteouspassion
againstthe inertness of despair,
the cui bono of his disenchanted
existence. He tries to rouse him- self,
but in vain. What were
the good 1 If Claudius were slain,
would that restore honour and
purity to the desecrated house?
could anything remake that pol- luted
mother into the type of holy
womanhood above corruption1 He
tries to work himself up to the
point of action, but there is no
hope in him to givevigour to his
arm. Something of the old energy
bursts out in fitsand starts,but is
paralysedby this supreme sickness
of heart and failure of all possibili- ties
of restoration. What Hamlet
wants is more than a vengeance : it
is a re-creation. Nothing short of
the undoing of all the monstrous
evil which has killed his soul in
him, is worth his livingfor. Mend- ing
is futile,the harm is too funda- metl,
the misery too complete.
Revenge would be a momentary sat
isfaction,would givehim ease, as
when a wounded man tears off his
bandages; but what more could
revenge do for Hamlet? Eestore
to him his world of youth, his
trust in those around him, his be- lief
that one is pure and another
true,his spotlessmother,his inno- cet
love,his loyalfriends'?" ah
no ! not one of them. And there- fore,
now with flashes of wild scorn,
now with utterances of deepestsad- ness,
he stands " hesitating," as we
say, before the vengeance which
will,he sees, be but a deception
like all the rest,and make no real
difference. Leopardi,the gloomy
shadow of an actual Hamlet,had no
possibilityeven of a stroke for life
in the shapeof a revenge, no palp- abe
wrong which he could identify,
nor practicalblow that would help
him a little,or which he could even
pretend might help him. There- fore
the nobilityof a struggleis
wanting in him. More grandly,
on nobler lines,and with a more
majesticmodelling,the poet has
worked out his fatallyilluminated,
disenchanted,disappointed,heroic
soul. Let shallow Laertes storm for
his vengeance, but in the profound
depthsof Hamlet's nature there is
no more room for delusion. As
Macbeth murdered sleep,so has
villanymurdered truth,the soul of
the world ;
but that last and awful
murder is not to be made up for
by the death of the villain. That
is trivial,a nothing,a momentary
anodyne, a little salve put to the
burningof the heart-deepwound :
but no remedy; for remedy is be- yond
possibility, beyond even hope.
This in our opinionis the interpre- tation
of Hamlet, so far as his great
and noble manhood is capableof a
set interpretation.All throughthe
darkness that has closed round him
there strike flickeringsof a former
light,which show the real nature,
instinct with grace and sweetness
of his character. When he is first
presentedto us, his "
inkycloak "
is
not more new to him than is the
gloom^thatenvelopshis life. This
gloom dates back but these two
little months " not two : nay, per- haps
not more than half that
period:since the secret horrors that
lie beneath the surface of common
livingfirstburst upon him " not in
his father's death,a natural sorrow,
but in the monstrous inconstancy
and wantonness of his mother. Be- fore
that unparalleledrevelation of
evil came, what had Prince Hamlet
been?
" The glassof fashion and the mould of
form :
The expectancy and rose of the fair
state :
""
the very hope and flower of noble
youth in Denmark. It is easy to
collect the traces of that lightand
sweet existence after itis past. The
warmth of his faith in the one last
prop that remains to him, his faith-ul
Horatio,is at the firstmoment
scarcelylessreadyand genialthan his
salutation of the other friends who
are not true :
" Good lads,how do ye
both ?
" he cries,with happy frank- ness,
to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern,before
he has seen the treach- ery
in their faces ;
and when he has
begunto suspectthat treachery,with
what pathosof recollection does he
remind them of the time in which
there was no suspicion,adjuring
them "by the rightsof our fellow- ship,
by the consonancy of our
youth, by the obligationof our
ever-preservedlove "
! This is no
melancholy philosopherabove the
range of the young cavaliers,the sol- diers
and scholars of Wittenberg;
but a true comrade " one whose
superiorrank made him onlymore
generous
in his brotherhood,more
dependent upon their affection.
And it is by means of the happy
likingsof his youththat almost all
the macliineryof the drama is con- structed.
The playersare brought
to him naturally,as to the source of
patronage and favour. They had
been of his retinue before,and he
knows each one, and has a gracious
word for the hobbledehoy who
playsthe women's parts,as well as
for the leader of the troupe,whose
emotion at his own performance
fillsthe princewith a sad yet not
unamused wonder. If he had not
been their constant patron, and
known their capacityof old, the
expedient of the play could not
have come in. And the very cli- max
of the tragedyis procuredby
similar means. Even in the midst
of his great gloom and overthrow,
Hamlet is still capable of being
piqued by the brag of Laertes' pro- ficiency
in fencing,which proves
that such an accomplishmentwas
of pricewith him. But for this
there would have been no appro- priateness
in the king'swager on
Ids head. It is "
a very riband in
the cap of youth,"part of "the
light and careless living"of the
blooming season. Strangewords to
be appliedto Hamlet ! yet so true
that the skill of a rival has still
sufficient force to kindle the halfquenched
fireof youthfulemulation
in him, notwithstandingall his bur- dens.
Last of all,there is the trifling
of earlylove " less love than fancy"
shaped upon the fantastic models of
the reigningfashion,which Hamlet
had not been too serious to play
with,like his contemporaries.The
letter which Polonius reads to the
king and queen is such a letter as
Sir Percie Shafton might have
written,the lightesttraffic of lovemaking,
half sport,half earnest,"
all youthfulextravaganceand com- pliment.
" To my soul's idol,the
beautified Ophelia,"" "an illphrase,
a very vile phrase,"as Polonius
justlyadds. This gay essay of gal- lntry
is preciselywhat Laertes
calls it in his earlyadvice to his
sister,"
a fashion and a toy in
blood ;
"
it is nothing more than
" the triflingof his favour." " Per- haps
he loves you now," the pru- dent
brother says ;
but it is the
lightfancyof youth,the inclination
of nature in its crescent,not any
guarantee for what may be when
"the inward service of the mind
and soul" has attained its full
width and growth. Still more de- cided
upon this point is Polonius.
" For Lord Hamlet,believe so much
in him that he is young,"says the
wary old chamberlain. He has
been a dangerous young gallant,a
noble princefull of all the charms
and entertainments of his age ; sur- rounded
by gay comrades, soldier
and courtier and scholar ; ready for
every fresh amusement, to hear
everythingnew the playershave on
hand,to tryhis skillagainstwhoever
offers,to wear a fair lady'sfavour
in his cap. Such has been the
goldenyouthof the Prince of Den- mark
: until suddenly,all at once,
as at the crack of doom, the mask
has broken off the fair face of the
world,and Hamlet has made the ir- redeemable
discoverythat nothing
is as it seems.
It mightbe too long to attempt
to show how the foundations of the
world were more entirelybroken
up by the specialguise in which
this calamityovertook him, than
theycould have been to Hamlet in
any other. There is indeed scarcely
any way in which the whole keynote
of nature could have been changed
to him exceptthis. It could be done
to Othello by the supposedfalsehood
of the woman in whom his lifehad
reblossomed,who was his consola- tion
for allthe labours of existence ;
but no falsehood of love could have
struck to despairthe young man
only lightlystepping within the
primrose path of dalliance,and
capableof no tragicpassionthere.
Where lie could be struck was in
the very fountain of his life" his
mother. The most degraded mind
finds a certain refugethere. A
woman by very rightof maternity
is lifted out of the impuritiesand
suspicionswhich may assail even
those who are
"
as chaste as ice,as
pure as snow." She has a shield
cast before her to quench all evil
thoughts.If truth failseverywhere
else,yet in her there is the source,
the springsof unpollutedlife,the
fountain of honour,the one original
type of faithful affectionwhich can- not
be doubted,even if heaven and
earth were meltingand dissolving.
While that foundation stands fast,
the world must still stand ;
it can- not
fallinto irremediable ruin and
destruction. When Hamlet first
comes before us in " the customary
suit of sober black/'which is in
itself a protestationagainstthat
unnatural marriage,this entire re- volution
of heaven and earth has
happened to him. He is dragged
in the train of the pageant, wit- nessing
his mother's re-enthrone- ment,
lookingon at all the endear- ments
of her monstrous bridehood,
sick with disgustand misery,un- able
to turn his back upon it all,or
save himself from the dishonour
that invades his own veins from
hers. " Fie on't! 0 fie!
"
he cries,
with a loathingwhich involves all
the world,and even himself,in its
sick horror. The earth is
" An unweeded garden,
That grows to seed; things rank, and
gross in nature,
Possess it merely."
Foulness is everywhere. Oh that
he could but melt and dissolve
away " that it could be permittedto
him to be no longer,to get done
with the very consciousness of liv- ing.
" Heaven and earth !
" he
cries, in the impatience of his
wretchedness," must I remem- 
"Within a month,"
Let me not think on't." Frailty,thy
name is woman !
A little month ; or ere those shoes were
old,
With which she follow'd my poor father's
body,
Like Niobe, all tears ;
" why she, even
she,"
0 God ! a beast,that wants discourse of
reason,
Would have mourned longer."
This horrible revelation of evil
in the placewhere it should have
been least suspected,this certainty
which nothing can changeor ex- cuse
or atone for,is the founda- tion
of all that follows. The
murder is less,not more than this.
It may be proved,it may be re- vnged,
and in any case it givesa
feverish
energy to the sufferer,an
escape for the moment from a deep- er
bitterness still;but even were
it disprovedor were it avenged,it
would changenothing. The worst
that can happenhas happened;that
first discoverywhich makes every
other possiblehas been made. How
it is graduallysupplementedby
other treacheries,and how the noble
victim finds himself surrounded by
every cheat that is most appalling
to his nature,all chimingin,with
one baseness after another,is in our
judgment the real argument of the
tragedy" ending as it does in an
imbroglioof heapedfalsehood upon
falsehood,confusion of murderous
lie on lie,which leads to the only
end that is possible" an end of uni- versal
slaughter,embodyingat once
the utter success and failureof multi- plied
treachery,not capableof stop- ping
when it would. The murder is
broughtinto the foreground,arrest- ing
the attention of the spectator,
holdingthe chief placefor a time,
then utterlydisappearingduringthe
last act as if it had not been " be- cause
it is,in fact,not the central
strain of the drama at all,but only
a tremendous complicationgiving
life and temporary vigour to the
hero's terrible illumination and
despair.
Let us endeavour to trace this
under-swell of dark and accumu- lating
misery through the play.
Hamlet is, in fact,roused into
heroic action whenever the question
of his father's murder is really
before him : he vacillates about
his vengeance; but in the great
scenes with the ghost,the arrange- ments
for the players,and also the
interview with his mother, there
is neither hesitation nor weakness
about him. It is when outside the
range of that inspiringexcitement
that the darker misery seizes pos- sesion
of his soul; and this we
think we shall be able to show.
As for the madness which he has
declared it to be his intention to
simulate,we see very little of that
on the stage or in the text. We
are left to infer that he must
have carried out his own sugges- tions
of policy("I perchancehere- aftr
may think meet to put an
antic dispositionon "),by the fact
that immediately after the scene
with the ghost (inwhich there is
certainlyno madness) we plunge
almost at once into the talk of the
court about "Lord Hamlet's lun- acy."
This appears to have devel- oped
so gradually,as to have left the
king and queen time to send to Wit- tenberg
for Eosencrantz and Guildenstern
;
but the only evidence we
have of it is the report which the
frightenedOphelia brings to her
father of the strange visit the
prince has paid her as she was
" sewing in her closet." Ophelia,
to judge by the admonitions of her
relatives,had not been by any
means disinclined to admit the
wooing of Hamlet. " You have
of your audience been most free
and bounteous,"says her father "

"From this time
Be somewhat scanter of your maiden

The simple and submissive girl,

brief career before us, entirelyun- conscious,
it is evident, of any
claim of loyaltyin love,and who
thinks a great deal more of her
father's approbationthan of what
is due to Hamlet " givesus in real- ity
the onlything that approaches
to evidence of madness on his part.
" 0 my lord,my lord,I have been
so affrighted!
" she cries,rushing
with a child's simple impulse to
her father.
"Lord Hamlet, " with his doublet all
unbrac'd ;
No hat upon his head ;
his stockings
foul;d,
Ungarter'd,and down-gyved to his ankle ;
Pale as his shirt ;
his knees knocking
each other,
And with a look so piteousin purport,
As if he had been loosed out of hell,
To speak of horrors," he comes before me.
Pol. Mad for thy love ?
Oph. My lord,I do not know ;
But, truly,I do fear it.
Pol. What said he?
Oph. He took me by the wrist,and
held me hard:
Then goes he to the lengthof all his arm ;
And, with his other hand thus o'er his
brow,
He falls to such perusalof my face,
As he would draw it. Long stay'dhe so ;
At last," a little shaking of mine arm,
And thrice his head thus waving up and
down, "
He raised a sighso piteousand profound,
As it did seem to shatter all his bulk,
And end his being: that done, he lets
me go;
And, with his head over his shoulder
turn'd,
He seem'd to find his way without his
eyes ;
For out o' doors he went without their
help,
And, to the last,bended their lighton
me."
Curiouslyenough,this is the only
singlebit of evidence in the whole
play which, we venture to say,
would be received by any court as
proof of Hamlet's madness. His
own lightand bitter "chaff" with
Polonius would take in no lawyer.
Whether it might be that in the
interval which takes place behind
the scenes, Hamlet had perceived
that the sweet, childish nature of
Opheliahad been taken possession
of by the old courtier,and that she
was a real,ifinnocent,snare for him,
it is hard to tell;
but it is scarcely
possiblefor the reader to imagine
a delusion more absurd than that
the greatand princelyHamlet had
gone mad for the love of Ophelia.
Though her pretty simplicityand
haplessfate givea factitious interest
to her,it is manifest that this soft
submissive creature, playinginto
her father's hands as she does,is in
no way a possiblemate for Hamlet ;
neither does he say a word which
would justifyus in thinkingthat
any serious passionfor her increased
the confusion of painand miseryin
his mind. Perhaps that long per- usal
of her face,of which she tells
her father,was the regretful,tender
leave-takingof the man from whom
all toys and fashions of the blood
had fallen away, who could write
sonnets no longer,nOr rhymes to his
lady'seyebrow. Anyhow, the fact
remains that duringthe time which
elapsedbetween Hamlet's resolution
to "
put an antic dispositionon,"
and the arrival of Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern at the requestof the
king,the events upon which the
notion of Hamlet's madness has
been built had taken place,and
that all we know of them is this
report of Ophelia's. He has, it
would appear, "borne himself
strange and odd," as he said he
would do, and Polonius has. found
out the reason on his side,and
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern have
been sent for to do it on theirs
When Hamlet appears to us again,he
is mocking Polonius with wild talk
" talk so full of meaning and mis- chief,
that even the old chamberlain
with his foregoneconclusion in his
head,is fain to give vent to the
confession,"though this be mad- ness,
yet there's method in't."
This transparent assumption of
follyblows off the moment he sees
the new-comers, whom he meets at
first with the frankest pleasure.
" Sure I am, there are not two men
livingto whom he more adheres,"
the queen has said ;
and the recep- tion
which Hamlet givesthem fully
carries out his mother's description.
Eut either there is something in
their air which prompts suspicion,
or the new-born doubts in his mind
make him questionclosely," What
make you at Elsinore 1
"
Alas ! the
generous and truthful Hamlet has
now got that lightof bitter illumi- nation
in his eyes which sees through
all disguises.In a little keen
quick play of persistentquestion
and unwillingreply,he has got the
secret of their mission. He accepts
that too : his friends have fallen
away from him, and turned into
spiesand* emissaries of his foe. The
rest of the interview with these
false friends is wrought with the
most marvellous skill : the sup- pressed
passionin it mingledwith
that levityof the sick heart which
is more sad than despair.At first
he seems to make almost an appeal
to their sympathies,when he tells
them how he has " lost all my
mirth,foregoneall custom of exer- cises
;
"
but seeing this does not
move one spark of the old fellowfeelingwithin
them,Hamlet accepts
the position,this time with a smile
of bitter yet tranquilunderstand- ing.
That which would have been
so greatan evil,so miserable a dis- aster
before " what is it now but a
faint echo of the downfall already
accomplished1 Fate having already
done her worst,this bitterness the
more but chimes in like an antici- pated
refrain. Yet the pain of it
tells even in the greateranguish,
and rises to a climax of indignant
remonstrance when, after the hypo- critical
appealhis false friends make
to his old affection,Hamlet, scorn- ing
to givethem more distinct reply,
takes the " recorder " from the hands
of the playerand offers it first to
one, then to the other. " Will you
playupon this pipe1
" he says ;
" 'tis
as easy as lying: govern these
ventages with your ringers and
thumb, give it breath with your
mouth, and it will discourse most
eloquent music." " Why, look
you, now," he adds, "how un- worthy
a thing you make of me !
You would play upon me ; you
would seem to know my stops;
you would pluck out the heart of
my mystery. . . . 'Sblood,do
you think I am easier to be played
on than a pipe?" Mr Irvingin
a fury" quite out of character,we
think,with the concentrated scorn
and pain,the pang yet smile of the
outburst which is far too sad for
passion" breaks violently'across his
knee the "little organ," which
appears to those shallow deceivers
so much more difficult to under- stand
than Hamlet's great heart
and nature. But passionor vio- lence
is not in the contrast between
the simplepipeand the man's soul.
It leaves them confounded, poor
creatures as they are " yet stillnot
altogethersure, so great is the for- bearance
of his protest,notwith- standing
the reluctant contempt in
it" that they may not yet deceive
him again, and get the better of
him, and worm their way into his
secret. In no part of the play is
his attitude more noble " highas the
heavens above the falsehood which
is wringing his very heart,yet
deeply,profoundlyconscious of it
than in those scenes. His firstdis- enchantment
has been so complete,
and has cut the ground so entirely
from under his feet,that this is no
new revelation to him. He bears
it even, standingthere alone,on so
much solid ground as his feet can
cover, no more, with a smile " but
the smile is one of utter and in- expressible
pain.
There remains but one thing in
which Hamlet might still find a
shred of truth and faithfulness.
Accordingto our opinionOphelia
has always been too slightand
small a creature to have much hold
upon such a spirit" and his per-tual
gibesand flouts at Polonius,
speciallyon the subject of his
daughter,would be cruel,had he
not an idea that some plot or
other in respect to his daughter
was brewing in the old courtier's
mind ;
but when the deepestmus- ings
of his sadness are disturbed by
the entrance of that last and cruellest
spy upon him, Hamlet does not
seem at firstto contemplatethe pos- sibility
that Opheliatoo might be in
the plotagainsthim. Her evidently
concerted appearance at that mo-ent,
a calculated chance to secure
the prince'sattention,rouses him
from thoughts so different that
he perceivesher with a passing
impatience. And it is hard to
believe that even Opheliais con- scious
of the full meaning of the
snare which she is made to set.
Something of simplicity,something
of stupidity,is in the device " which
is probablyall her own, and unsuggestedby
the other conspirators"
of bringing Hamlet's love -tokens
to restore to him at such a mo-ent
and under such circumstances.
Though she thinks he is mad of
love for herself,and though she
knows that her father and the king
are lying in watch to listen,she
tempts her crazed lover,as she
imagines,to betrayhis most secret
feeling?,by those soft reproaches,
which at another placeand time
would have been so affecting " ap- peals
to his tenderest recollections,
and patheticprotest against his
abandonment of her. A woman
forsaken could not do more iu a
supreme effortto reclaim the heart
that has strayedfrom her. Her
falteringreference to the " words of
so sweet breath composed as made
the thingsmore rich,"the faint and
plaintiveindignationof her conclu- sion,
"Rich giftswax poor, when
giversprove unkind,"would be ex- quisitely
touchingdid we not know
of those spiesbehind the arras.
They are exquisitelytouching,we
believe,to the great part of the
public,who, soft-hearted to the soft
Ophelia,forgetthat this whole
meetingis a plot,and that she has
contrived,in her simplicity,a still
more delicate refinement of the
snare, by thus throwingupon him
the sudden shadow of the past.
For a moment Hamlet seems to
pause.
" I humbly thank you,
well,well,well,"he says, in answer
to her question,with somethingin
his tone of fear,lest this softness
should melt him, and his stepsbe
tempted into a way less rude and
terrible than that which lies before
him. But when the meaningof the
whole situation suddenly flashes
upon him " when his rapidglance
detects the listeners at one side,
while the seeming-simplemaiden
falters forth her reproacheson
the other " a blaze of sudden
scorn and wrath suddenly illumi- nates
the scene. A stab delivered
by so soft a hand cuts to the heart.
She too, suborned by his enemies,
made into a trap for him, endea- vouring
to seduce him to a selfbetrayalmore
intimate,more sacred,
than any that his false friends
could hope to attain ! The pang is
so keen that Hamlet is cruel and
terrible to the soft and shrinking
creature. He rails at her as if she
were a wanton, and crushes her
under his contempt. " Go thy
ways to a nunnery " to a nunnery
" go !;" he cries,with,for the first
time,a shrill tone of anger in his
voice. She to whose orisons he
commends himself one moment, is
denounced the next in terms as
harsh and disdainful as were ever
used to the most abandoned sin- ner.
His words beat her down
like a hailstorm on a flower. He
has no pity" no mercy. That com- bination
of the last appealto his
tenderness with the concealed and
cruel plot against him betrays
Hamlet to an outburst which under
less provocationwould be unmanly.
He insults the woman who has
made a snare for him out of her
own very tenderness. The ex- quisite
art which keeps up our
sympathy for the bewildered and
crushed Ophelia,notwithstanding
what would be the baseness of her
disloyaltywere she sufficiently ele- vated
in character to understand
the treacherous partshe is playing,
is wonderful. It leaves a haze of
mortal uncertaintyabout her char- acter
altogether,such as veils the
actual being of our contemporaries,
and leaves us at libertyto think
better or worse of them according
to the pointof view from which
we see- them," a licence which has
secured for Opheliaa placeamong
Shakespeare'sheroines which does
not seem to be justifiedby any- thing
but the prettinessand pathos
of her mad scenes. Her submissive
obedience to every impulsefrom her
father scarcelybalances her absolute
want of perceptionof any truth
or delicacywhich she owes to
Hamlet, for whose betrayalshe al- lows
herself,without apparent re- sistance,
to be made the decoy.
Thus the last blow that Fortune
can now strike at him has fallen"
his friends have abandoned him ;
his simplelove,the innocent crea- ture
in whom, if no loftypassion
was possible,there still seemed
every commendation to sweet do- mestic
trust and truth,has done her
best to betrayhim. What remains
for this man to whom all the world
has turned traitor,under whose feet
the solid soil has crumbled, who
sees nothing but yawning ruin
round him, abysses of darkness,
bottomless pitsof falsehood,wher- ev
he may turn ?
This,it seems to us, is the deep- est
and chief strain in the tragedy.
The murder and the vengeance he
would take for it,would his sick
heart leave him enough possibil- ity
of livingto give the necessary
standing-groundfor the blow " form
the sole source of energy and life
which he retains. That cruel and
monstrous wrong, for which he can
yet get some amends, rouses him
from the deadlycollapseof every
hope and wish which he cannot
escape, which nothingin heaven or
earth can remedy. The passionof
the great scene with the ghost
bringsbefore us another Hamlet,
a heroic figure,altogetherawakened
out of the sick and miserable mus- ing,
the impotentstillanger and pain
of his previousappearance.
" Re- mmber
theeT' he cries;"
ay, thou
poor ghost,while memory holds a
seat in this distracted globe."
And the wild humour of his ex- citement
as he makes his com- panions
.swear to secrecy, is not
more unlike the bitter satire of
hopelessdespondency with which
in a previousscene he explainshis
mother's marriageas
" thrift,thrift,
pure thrift" " than is the roused
and passionatefervour of his action
from the apathy of spectatorshipin
which we have seen him plunged
from the first. Again, the gleam
of revival which occurs when the
playerVpresent themselves, and
he "perceivesa readymeans in his
hand of convictingthe criminal,
confirmingthe apparition,and strik- ing
a first and subtle blow, once
more restores force and lifeto Ham- let.
There is no vacillation in his
measures then. How prompt, how
ready,how practicalare all his com- binations
! Once more he is de- livered
from the deadly influence
of that eatingfalsehood,and truth
becomes possible.
" I have heard
That guiltycreatures sittingat a play,
Have by the very cunning of the scene
Been struck so to the soul,that presently
They have proclaim'dtheir malefactions.
For murder, though it have no tongue,
will speak
With most miraculous organ."
After the terrible success of this
experiment,we are not left time to
see any further falteringof purpose.
The events follow in breathless
succession. The great scene with
his mother and the killingof Polonius
take placethe same evening
" and that very nightor the morn- ing
immediatelysucceeding,without
pause or delay,he is swept away
to England on the expeditionfrom
which the king hopes he may never
return. The " vacillation " with
which Hamlet is continuallycre- dited,
and of which so much has
been said,is all confined to the un- told
periodbetween the appearance
of the ghostand the pointat which
the storyresumes, with the treach- eries
of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern,and
of Ophelia. After he has
made sure by the trialto which he
subjectshis uncle at the play,of the
guiltof the king,Hamlet, save at
the moment when he surprisesthe
criminal on his knees,and decides
not to kill him, has no further
opportunityfor vacillation. And
here the sustained action of the tra- gedy
may be said to end. The last
act is a bewilderingpostscript,in
which all the mysteriesof the pre- vious
close and elaborate pieceof
tragedyare swept up. It mightbe
almost a new play,so different is it
" or the beginningof a continua- tion
which shows us all the former
occurrences thrown into distance
and perspective.Of the original
actors none remain except Kamlet
himself,the king and queen, and
the two lay figuresof Horatio and
Laertes. Opheliais gone, all her
simplicitiesand artless treachery
ended in a prettyfoolish madness
as much unlike the " lunacyof the
Lord Hamlet "
as can be conceived ;
and old Polonius,wagginghis wise
old head in shallow sagacity;
and
the young court friends,who cannot
understand their princelycompan- ion,
but can betray him " all are
swept away. And with them has
gone Hamlet's despair,and his plan
of vengeance, and allthose obstinate
questioningswith which he has en- deavoured
to blow aside the veil of
human uncertainty.We tread new
ground,and enter a new contracted,
less impassionedworld.
All this time,though we have
discussed Hamlet much, we have
given but little attention to Mr
Irving,thoughit is his performance
which has furnished the text of the
disquisition.Notwithstandingthe
very serious and conscientious per- fomance
he gives us, it is very
difficult to judge what is the con-eption
he has formed of the char- acter
of Hamlet. He would seem
rather to have studied the drama
scene by scene, endeavouringwith
all his powers to givewhat seems to
him an adequaterepresentation of
each,than to have addressed himself
to the character as a whole. And
though there are generalcriticisms
of the superficialkind to be ad- dressed
to him, such as the very
natural and reasonable objectionto
the languagehe speaks,which cer- tainly
is quiteas imperfectEnglish
as that which any foreignermay
have made use of" we are prevent
ed by our inabilityto discriminate
what his idea is,from findingany
fault with that idea. He wants
humour so entirely,that the wild
patheticgleamsof diversion which
lightup the gloom are lost to his
audience ;
and the laugh which
breaks in at the most bitter mo-ents
" that laughwhich is fullof
tears,yet is nevertheless instinct
with a wildlyhumorous perception
of thingsludicrous and incongru- ous
" loses all its distinctive char- acter,
and becomes a mere hyster- ical
symbol of excessive emotion,
no more expressivethan a shriek.
And he wants the flexibility, the
ready change from one mood to
another,the rapidityof transition
which bewilders Hamlet's common- place
companions. The broken
jest,so strangelynatural,yetto the
vulgareye so unsuited to the occa- sion,
with which he hails the inter- ruptions
of the ghost" his fantastic
foolingof Polonius " even the light- er
touches between deadlyjestand
earnest with which his interview
with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
is full" are all beyond Mr Irving's
power. And the wild outburst of
tragicgaietyinto which he breaks
when the assemblyis broken up
after the play,becomes mere mad
bellowingand screamingin Mr
Irving'shands,without any sugges- tion
of that waveringof the mind
at the very summit of tragicsatis- fction,
consternation,and horror,
frantic with meaning,yet a world
apart from madness,which is per- haps
the furthest step humanity
can take into what is expressible
and capable of being put into
words : it is a step beyond the
actor's powers. To embody the
vicissitudes,the extremes, the
heights and depths of this most
wonderful of poeticalcreations,who
could be sufficient who did not to
some degreeshare Hamlet's nature,
his iargeeyesight,his c
sion of small and great,his suscep- tibility
to every breath that flits
across the mental horizon? This
last qualityapparentlyMr Irving
does not perceiveat all ;
for we are
sure that if he perceivedit he
would devote himself to a study of
all the ripplingsof sensitive faces,
all the transitions of changeable
minds. His own countenance is at
times finelyexpressive,but it has
not been made for the flickerings
of a mind at once spontaneous and
complex. Its force is single,uni,
not mingled but of one colour.
Hamlet is too great to be called
versatile,a word reserved by us
for the use of characters of slighter
mould ;
but there is all the gamut
in him, and no difficultyin going
at once from the height to the
depth of the moral scale. But Mr
Irving possesses no such varied
power of expression;
and this must
always be fatallyin his way when
it is necessary to attempt those
shades of meaning which are in- finite,
and which vary with every
breath.
As an instance,however,of what
seems to us completemisconception
more serious than simple failure,
we may instance the scene with
Ophelia,which no doubt is one of
the most difficult in the play. It
is hard in any case (notwith- standing
that the doctrine is pop- ular)
to give a persistenttone of
superiorityto a man's intercourse
with a woman without offending
the finer perceptionsas well as the
wholesome prejudicesof the audi- ence,
which naturallyrange them- selves
on the woman's side;and it is
stillmore difficultto show the turn
of sentiment,and justifyHamlet's
wild and sudden onslaughtupon so
soft and shrinkinga nature. Mr
Irving avoids this by turning the
scene into one of the most impas- sioned
and frantic love " love of
gesture and attitude,since he can
not change the words,which are as
unlike love-makingas ever were put
on paper. His Hamlet can scarce- ly
restrain himself from clasping
Ophelia to his heart,his arms are
all but closed around her, and
when he turns himself away it is
but to turn back, drawn by an
attraction which it takes not only
all his power of resolution but all
his muscular force to resist. Those
embracings of the air,those futile
snatchingsand withdrawals,are sup- posed
to be proofsof a violent and
passionatelove,restrained or broken
either by madness or by misery"
Mr Irvingdoes not clearlygive us
to understand which " but certainly
belongingat least to a most robust
sentiment,for even the sightof the
half - concealed spectators,about
whose presence it is impossiblehe
can deceive himself,makes no dif- ference
to him; and he goes on
with those wild half-embraces and
the strangestpantomimic struggle
of passionafter he knows of the
plot and treachery,making an ex- hibition
of his feelingsunder the
very noses of the watchers. From
whence Mr Irvingcan have taken
this extraordinaryconceptionit is
impossibleto tell. It is contra- dicted
not only by every word
Hamlet says, but by the verdict of
the spiesafter. " Love ! his affec- tions
do not that way tend,"says
the king, more clear-sightedthan
Mr Irving; though, indeed, had
Mr Irving been Hamlet (as,thank
heaven ! he is not),Polonius must
have remained master of the field,
since nothingcould justifyhis mad
behaviour but the old courtier's
theory. There are many jarring
notes in the performance,but none
so entirelyfalse as this.
On the equallydelicate ground
where Hamlet is confronted by the
other treacheryin the persons of
Guildenstern and Eosencrantz,Mr
Irvingismuch more happy. Though
he is incapableof the lightbanter
which conceals so much tragicfeel- ing,
his intercourse with them is well
done throughout,thoughsomewhat
extreme in gravity. The search- ing
look,which is the firstevidence
of his doubts,follows very quickly
upon his cordial recognitionof his
fellow-students ;
and the manner in
which he penetratesthroughtheir
shiftingand paltrydefences is fine
in its realityand concentrated ob- servation
" a study as successful as
the encounter with Opheliais false.
In the one case he has caughtthe
true tone of the character,in the
other goes wilfullyagainstit,and
againstevery indication of the text.
The fine scene with the recorder,to
which we have alreadyreferred,is
somewhat spoiledby the violence
with which he breaks,when he has
served his purpose, the pipewhich
has proved so powerfulan illustra- tion
of his meaning ;
but this isa de- tail
which may easilybe pardoned,
all the rest being so satisfactory.
By the way, the introduction of the
recorder,not only in Mr Irving's
arrangement, but in every other we
have seen, is singularlyartificial.
Hamlet has demanded "
some music
" the recorders,"in his wild exul- tation
at the end of the play-scene,
meaning evidentlya performance
of music to soothe or inspirehis
excited fancy,or to take the place
of the entertainment so summarily
interrupted.The recorder,how- ever,
is brought to him as if he
had asked for it simply to give
the courtiers their lesson,the idea
of music to be performed before
him failingaltogether.Mr Irving's
careful zeal for all these matters
mightwell be exerted on this point
to make the introduction of the in- strument
more natural.
That he does not think any detail
trivialis apparent from his notes in
a contemporary,the last of which is
occupiedwith a defence of his own
practicein withdrawingthe two
portraitsof traditionaryuse, which
have hitherto figuredin the queen's
chamber,and afforded a visible text
for Hamlet's speech"
" Look here,
upon this picture,and on this." Mr
Irving'scrotchet on this point is
reallyunimportant; though it is
somewhat confusing,we think,to
the spectator,to have so distinct an
allusion without any visible ground
for it ;
and the suggestionhe makes,
that the stage has four walls,and
that the portraitsmay be supposed
to be hangingupon that which "is
onlytheoretical "
" which,in reality,
is the theatre,with all its crowding
faces" is somewhat ludicrous. The
absence of the portraits,or of the
miniatures which sometimes do duty
for them, weakens the force of the
speech,in so far as any failure of
external accessories can weaken it,
which is a trivial quantity. But
this accessory to which the text
seems to point is,on the whole,
more importantthan the chambercandle
which Hamlet, with real at- tention,
lightsand hands to his
mother at the conclusion of the in- terview,
neglecting,however,as we
cannot but feel,to remind her of
the night-gear,evidentlyairingat
the fire,which givestruth and local
colour to the room ; though,after
all,it is not the queen'sbedroom,
but only some boudoir appartenant,
or there would be no need for
the chamber - candle at all. The
scene which takes place in this
room is strangelylopped and cut ;
something it may be necessary to
omit in deference to modern modes- ties,
but these are somewhat too
much regardedin a scene of passion
so intense. And the sudden vehe- mnce
of Hamlet's action,when the
voice behind the arras rouses him
into wild rapidityof impulse,leav- ing
no time for thought,loses all
its force in Mr Irving'streatment.
He liftsthe arras before he strik
making any doubt about the per- son
of the victim impossible,and
taking the meaning out of his own
question,"Is it the king?" It
" must be remembered that he has
come there stillbreathless with the
wild emotion of the play-scene;
that he has passed,on his way,
through the oratorywhere the king
is praying,and has spared him ;
and that the transport of sudden
passion with which he rushes at
the concealed spectator is a pay- ment
of long arrears to the arch- enemy,
who had alreadyused this
same mean device to surprisehis
thoughts. We cannot tell why Mr
Irving should have cut out two
lines of the words addressed to the
dead Polonius,which are far from
unnecessary :"
" Thou wretched,rash,intrudingfool,
farewell !
I took thee for thy better;take thyfor- tune
;
Thou find'stto be too busyissome danger""
is what Shakespearewrote ;
but
Mr Irvingomits the italics,leaving
the victim without even so much
disdainful regretas this.
Altogetherludicrous,too, is the
appearance of the ghostin this very
importantscene. The convolutions
of the queen'snight-drapery, which,
so far as she isconcerned,occupy the
most prominent placein the scene,
billowinghither and thither as she
is affected by Hamlet's vitupera- tions,
had, we confess,so occupied
our mind, that when, with a rush,
a venerable gentleman in familiar
domestic costume came on the
stage, shakingit with substantial
footsteps,the idea of the ghostdid
not presentitself at all to our dull
imagination;
and it was impossible
to avoid the natural idea that the
lady'shusband, hearing an unac- countable
commotion in the next
room, had jumped out of bed,
seized his dressing- gown, and
rushed in to see what was the
matter. The combination of this
and the chamber - candle which
Hamlet lightsso carefully,and the
night-gown airing at the fire,is
most unfortunate. These acces- sories
are a great deal more prosaic
than the introduction of pictures
would be ;
and we cannot but
wonder that the actor who leaves
so much to imagination at one
moment, should leave so little to
it at another.
There are many omissions,too,
which seem distinct faults in the re- presentation,
diminishingits effect
" as, for instance,at the end of
the play-scene,where the alarmed
phrasesexchangedby the spectators
occupy the moment necessary to
show us the king'sperturbation,
before the whole train suddenly
rushes away, and everything is
over. Here is the version of Shake- speare
:"
" Ham. He poisonshim i' the garden
for's estate. His name's Gonzago : the
storyis extant, and writ in choice Italian.
You shall see anon how the murderer gets
the love of Gonzago'swife.
Oph. The king rises.
Ham. What! frightedwith falsefire?
Queen.How faresmy lord?
Pol. Give o'er the play.
King. Give me some light:" away !
AIL Lights,lights,lights!
"
Mr Irving leaves out all that we
have put in italics,thus gaining
nothingin point of time,and en- tirely
missingthe confused con- sciousness
of the spectators,which
helps the effect of the scene so
greatly. As it is now beingrepre- sntd,
the king'sexclamation,and
the echoingcry of the courtiers for
lights,are all that is interposed
between the sudden flightof the
court and Hamlet's explanationof
the argument of the play. His
own outcry," What ! frightedwith
false fire1
"
is transposed,and comes
after the precipitatewithdrawal of
the royalparty. Thus the effect of
three independentwitnesses to th
king'sconviction and remorse, each
breakingin spontaneously,with a
risingexcitement which makes the
rush of the departureinfinitely more
tellingand lifelike,is entirelylost.
And no counterbalancingadvantage
is gainedby the omission of these
few but pregnant phrases,which do
not delaybut only elucidate the
action. We cannot understand,
either,why of Hamlet's wild dog- gerel
the verse which is universally
known and full of meaning,should
be omitted,while the second mad
rhyme is retained :
" Why, let the stricken deer go weep,
The hart ungalledplay,"
is as fit an expressionof the wild
feelingof the moment as could be
found " whereas the jinglethat is
retained is a mere maddening clat- ter
of words,expressiveenough of
the frantic levityof passionwhen
taken in conjunctionwith the other,
but far less worthyof preservation
than the other. We fail also to
perceiveany reason for leavingout
one of the best-known lines in the
Ghost's address to Hamlet, "Unhousel'd,disappointed,unanel'd."
Perhapsthere is no singleline in
the whole play the omission of
which would so strike the most
careless listener. It is like leaving
out a bar in a strain of music, and
withdraws our mind from the rest
of the speechinto involuntaryin- vestigation
of the mystery of this
incomprehensible" cut." Why, ex- cept
to make us stumble and dis- tract
our attention,should this have
been left out 1
The omission of the scene in the
oratory,the king'sprayer and Ham- let's
fierce and momentary self-dis- cusion
thereanent,is perhapsless
to be complainedof. We sincerely
sympathisewith Mr Irving in the
grievousdisappointmentshe must
encounter in the persons of his
kings.The Shakespearianmonarch
is a beingby himself;and how to
get him to look " not like a king,
but " like anythingbetter than a
hobby-horse,must be a labour of
Hercules such as only managers
fullyappreciate.It is much better
to leave the scene out altogether
than to associate only ludicrous
ideas with it. A gentlemanwhose
chief thought when he kneels is
about the knees of his " tights."
and who goes on serenelysaying
his prayers while the avenger rants
and waves a torch within a foot of
him, is better left out when he can
be left out. Indeed their majesties
of Denmark at the Lyceum must
be almost as greatan exercise to Mr
Irving'ssoul as were their originals
to Hamlet. The swingof their re- spective
mantles,especiallythat fine
wave of white silk liningfrom the
monarch's shoulder,isthe chief point
that strikes us. As for the queen,
the manner in which her majesty
swathes herself in her red and yellow
night-gownduringthe excitingscene
in her chamber,making its billows
and puffingsdo dutyfor the emo- tin
she shows but little trace of
otherwise,is probablydue to some
archaeologicalinstructions previous- ly
administered by Hamlet, rather
than to any inspirationof her own.
We cannot,however,pass over the
personnelof the drama without say- ing
somethingof Miss Ellen Terry's
Ophelia. No Opheliaof our time
has givento the character so grace- ful
a presence. The very excellence
of the actress,however,makes more
apparent the insignificanceof the
part allotted to her. Nothing can
make the submissive littledaughter
of Polonius a greatpoeticalheroine.
All the prejudicesof the audience
are in her favour,and we have
grown up with the idea that she
ranks among the Juliets and Rosa- linds
; and, unfortunately,it has
been very easy on most occasions
to assure ourselves that our disap-
pointment arose solelyfrom the in- capacity
of the actresses to whom
(anecessityfor a singingvoice be- ing
in itself a limitation to the
number of Ophelias possible)the
part was intrusted. But now that
we have a representativeto whom
no exception can be made, this
delusion fails us. Even Miss Terry
cannot givemore than the mildest
interest to the character. What
she can do she does ; though even
the sweet and animated archness
of her countenance, though capa- ble
of touching pathos,would be
more adaptedfor a Rosalind full of
life and action,than for the plain- tive
weakness of Ophelia.
The lastact of " Hamlet " remains
to ourselves a mystery. We can- not
attempt to discuss what we so
littleunderstand. Had not Shake- speare
been writing playsfor an
audience to which an orthodox
ending was necessary " had not
even the supreme creator laboured
under that necessityfor a third
volume with which critics upbraid
the smaller artists of fiction" it is
likelyenough that he would have
left this tale unfinished,as it is at
the end of the fourth act. There
is no end practicablefor such a
hero. Death indeed cuts the thread
artificiallyboth in real life and
poetry ; but it is an artificialend- ig,
however it comes about, and,
so far as we are concerned, solves
110 problem,though we make bold
to believe that it explainsevery- thing
to the person chieflycon-erned.
In the fifth act all is
changed. That former world has
rolled away with all its passions
and pains. Hamlet, having de- livered
himself by the promptest
energeticaction, in an emergency
which is straightforwardand with- ou
complications,comes back with a
languorand exhaustion about him
which contrasts strangelywith the
intensityof all his previouseino
tions. Contemplativeas ever, there
is no longerany strain of mystic
anguish in his musings. Unac- countably,
yet most evidently,the
greatness of his sufferinghas dis- solved
away. He walks into the
scene like a man recovered from an
illness" like one who has been
dreaming and is awake, a sadder
and a wiser man than he was only
yesternight. His speculationsin
the churchyardare all in a lower
key. Instead of those sublime
questioningsof earth and heaven
which formed the burden of all his
thoughts" instead of the passion
of disenchantment and cruel con- sciousness
of treacheryand false- hood
" the flightof his subdued
fancygoes no higherthan the base
uses to which the dust of humanity
may return. True, he starts into
spasmodic excitement when roused
by the rantingof Laertes over his
sister's grave, and meets him with
an outburst of responsiveranting,
in which there is a gleam of his old
wild humour, though subdued like
himself to a lower tone. " The
braveryof his griefdid put me into
a towering passion,"he exclaims
afterwards to Horatio ;
and his
sudden irritation and outdoing of
the swagger of his natural opponent
is the thing most like the Hamlet
of old in the whole postscriptalepi- sode.
So also in a mild degree is
the scene with the young euphuist
Osric,where prince and courtier
give us a dialoguein the manner
of Lyly, accordingto the fashion
of Elizabeth's time rather than
Hamlet's,wonderfullyreduced and
tamed from the wild and brilliant
play of the princewith Polonius in
the previousacts. Throughout the
growing rapidityof action with
which all thingstend towards the
catastrophe,Hamlet bears himself
with noble and unsuspiciousdig- nty
;
while the last murderous net- work
of deceit,which is compass-
ing his death, closes round him.
The hand of fate is upon him, his
insight is clouded with a great
weariness, his deep soul subdued.
It does not occur to him apparently
to ask why this
wager
of the king's,
or for what
purpose he, of all men
in the world, is backed
up
and set
forth as his champion by his nat- ural
enemy.
He walks this time
calmly, with melancholy grace,
into
the snare.
Thus Hamlet dies, as he has
suffered, by fraud. Treachery has
tracked him from the beginning of
the great and melancholy story.
It has broken his heart, it has
untwisted for him all the ties of
nature, it has made love and friend- ship
into delusions, and life itself
a troubled dream. What is the
secret of the subdued dead hush
and calm with which he comes
before us in the end? Is it mere
weariness, exhaustion of all possi- bility
of action, the sense that
nothing more remains worth strug- glin
for " for even his
revenge,
the one object which had kept
the channels of life clear, has dis- appeared
in the last chapter ? Who
can tell 1 only at the
very
end does
a gleam of the old passion flash
in his face, as he at last accom- plishes
that
vengeance,
and sends
his
enemy
before him into the land
of retribution. So far as our theory
goes,
the last act is in fact th
return of the poet to his real theme.
His hero has been wrecked through- out
by treachery. The higher be- trayals
that affected his heart and
soul wrun" Hamlet's being, and
transformed the world to him : but
the meaner tricks that assailed his
life were 1oo low for his suspicion.
How was he, so noble, so unfor- tunate,
measuring his soul against
the horrible forces of falsehood, the
spiritual wickedness in high places,
to come down from that impas- sioned
and despairing contest, to
think of poison, or take
precau- tions
against it? Thus the traitor
got the better of him, and death
triumphed at the last.
There is nothing to object to in
Mr Irving's performance of this last
portion of the play. It suits him
better than all that has
gone
before.
The anachronism which we believe
experts find in the exhibition of
a modern scientific manner of fenc- ing,
which could not have existed
in the
vague traditionary days of
Hamlet the Dane, is but a trifling
and scholarly grievance, and there
is no complication of passions to
carry
these scenes beyond the actor's
range.
If he would dispense with
the ludicrous head-dress which is
half like Mephistopheles and half
like a gipsy woman, we should
feel that Mr Irving's churchyard
scene was as satisfactory a render- ing
as we are likely to attain.
