 I don't like any shows very much, if you want to know the truth. They're not as bad as
movies, but they're certainly nothing to rave about. In the first place, I hate actors. They
never act like people. They just think they do. Some of the good ones do, in a very slight
way, but not in a way that's fun to watch. And if any actor's really good, you can always
tell he knows he's good, and that spoils it. You take Sir Laurence Olivier, for example. I
saw him in Hamlet. D.B. took Phoebe and I to see it last year. He treated us to lunch first,
and then he took us. He'd already seen it, and the way he talked about it at lunch, I was
anxious as hell to see it, too. But I didn't enjoy it much. I just don't see what's so
marvelous about Sir Laurence Olivier, that's all. He has a terrific voice, and he's a helluva
handsome guy, and he's very nice to watch when he's walking or dueling or something,
but he wasn't at all the way D.B. said Hamlet was. He was too much like a goddam
general, instead of a sad, screwed-up type guy. The best part in the whole picture was
when old Ophelia's brother--the one that gets in the duel with Hamlet at the very end--
was going away and his father was giving him a lot of advice. While the father kept
giving him a lot of advice, old Ophelia was sort of horsing around with her brother,
taking his dagger out of the holster, and teasing him and all while he was trying to look
interested in the bull his father was shooting. That was nice. I got a big bang out of that.
But you don't see that kind of stuff much. The only thing old Phoebe liked was when
Hamlet patted this dog on the head. She thought that was funny and nice, and it was.
What I'll have to do is, I'll have to read that play. The trouble with me is, I always have to
read that stuff by myself. If an actor acts it out, I hardly listen. I keep worrying about
whether he's going to do something phony every minute.
