###By Ben Jonson

To draw no envy, Shakespeare, on thy name, <br>
Am I thus ample to thy book and fame; <br>
While I confess thy writings to be such <br>
As neither man nor muse can praise too much; <br>
'Tis true, and all men's suffrage. But these ways <br>
Were not the paths I meant unto thy praise; <br>
For seeliest ignorance on these may light, <br>
Which, when it sounds at best, but echoes right; <br>
Or blind affection, which doth ne'er advance <br>
The truth, but gropes, and urgeth all by chance; <br>
Or crafty malice might pretend this praise, <br>
And think to ruin, where it seem'd to raise. <br>
These are, as some infamous bawd or whore <br>
Should praise a matron; what could hurt her more? <br>
But thou art proof against them, and indeed, <br>
Above th' ill fortune of them, or the need. <br>
I therefore will begin. Soul of the age! <br>
The applause, delight, the wonder of our stage! <br>
My Shakespeare, rise! I will not lodge thee by <br>
Chaucer, or Spenser, or bid Beaumont lie <br>
A little further, to make thee a room: <br>
Thou art a monument without a tomb, <br>
And art alive still while thy book doth live <br>
And we have wits to read and praise to give. <br>
That I not mix thee so, my brain excuses, <br>
I mean with great, but disproportion'd Muses, <br>
For if I thought my judgment were of years, <br>
I should commit thee surely with thy peers, <br>
And tell how far thou didst our Lyly outshine, <br>
Or sporting Kyd, or Marlowe's mighty line. <br>
And though thou hadst small Latin and less Greek, <br>
From thence to honour thee, I would not seek <br>
For names; but call forth thund'ring Aeschylus, <br>
Euripides and Sophocles to us; <br>
Pacuvius, Accius, him of Cordova dead, <br>
To life again, to hear thy buskin tread, <br>
And shake a stage; or, when thy socks were on, <br>
Leave thee alone for the comparison <br>
Of all that insolent Greece or haughty Rome <br>
Sent forth, or since did from their ashes come. <br>
Tri'umph, my Britain, thou hast one to show <br>
To whom all scenes of Europe homage owe. <br>
He was not of an age but for all time! <br>
And all the Muses still were in their prime, <br>
When, like Apollo, he came forth to warm <br>
Our ears, or like a Mercury to charm! <br>
Nature herself was proud of his designs <br>
And joy'd to wear the dressing of his lines, <br>
Which were so richly spun, and woven so fit, <br>
As, since, she will vouchsafe no other wit. <br>
The merry Greek, tart Aristophanes, <br>
Neat Terence, witty Plautus, now not please, <br>
But antiquated and deserted lie, <br>
As they were not of Nature's family. <br>
Yet must I not give Nature all: thy art, <br>
My gentle Shakespeare, must enjoy a part. <br>
For though the poet's matter nature be, <br>
His art doth give the fashion; and, that he <br>
Who casts to write a living line, must sweat, <br>
(Such as thine are) and strike the second heat <br>
Upon the Muses' anvil; turn the same <br>
(And himself with it) that he thinks to frame, <br>
Or, for the laurel, he may gain a scorn; <br>
For a good poet's made, as well as born; <br>
And such wert thou. Look how the father's face <br>
Lives in his issue, even so the race <br>
Of Shakespeare's mind and manners brightly shines <br>
In his well-turned, and true-filed lines; <br>
In each of which he seems to shake a lance, <br>
As brandish'd at the eyes of ignorance. <br>
Sweet Swan of Avon! what a sight it were <br>
To see thee in our waters yet appear, <br>
And make those flights upon the banks of Thames, <br>
That so did take Eliza and our James! <br>
But stay, I see thee in the hemisphere <br>
Advanc'd, and made a constellation there! <br>
Shine forth, thou star of poets, and with rage <br>
Or influence, chide or cheer the drooping stage; <br>
Which, since thy flight from hence, hath mourn'd like night, <br>
And despairs day, but for thy volume's light. <br>
