*This royal throne of kings, this sceptred isle, <br>
This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars, <br>
This other Eden, demi-paradise, <br>
This fortress built by Nature for herself <br>
Against infection and the hand of war, <br>
This happy breed of men, this little world, <br>
This precious stone set in the silver sea, <br>
Which serves it in the office of a wall <br>
Or as a moat defensive to a house, <br>
Against the envy of less happier lands, â€” <br>
This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this Website.*
